RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Following is an update on what has transpired concerning the Records
Management Program in the Leaf Department since I last wrote to you in March.

On August 6, 1991, the second revised issue of the Leaf Department records
retention schedule received the endorsements required for finalization. All
recently informed by Jane Newchok that one additional modification was still
required. 'However, since the requested change did not affect the maintenance
or retention of records, I would prefer to postpone revising your schedule
again until more critical changes are also needed. Our Records Management
legal counsel has been made aware of this issue and agrees.

The record category "Blend Sheets B1082" was placed under disposal suspension
by the Records Management legal counsel on July 23, 1991. These records have
been flagged in the Records Management data base and should not appear on any
disposal notices until the suspension has been released. I will let you know
when this occurs.

This month, 14 employees in the Leaf department were trained on the final
phase of the Records Management Program implementation. The diskettes to
capture their inventory data were distributed during this training session.
This month, I have started reporting their progress on this phase of
implementation. Attached is a chart showing the information that will be
reported monthly until this final phase of implementation has been completed.
I hope this will assist you in continuing to monitor the progress of the
Records Management Program implementation in the Leaf Department.

Reconciliation of inactive Leaf Department records in storage to your
approved departmental retention schedule continued throughout this reporting
period. I estimate this activity is about 80% complete. Based on the volume

The revised PM USA Records Management Manual has been approved by the Records
Management Joint Task Force and the President of Philip Morris USA. It will
be distributed soon from the Legal Department in New York. I will let you
and your departmental records coordinator know before this takes place.

LORILLARD SALES TRENDS


Newport -

Sales Continue to increase throughout the area. Most
signiﬁcant sales gm have been made in cigarette outlets,
tax differential outlets and convenience stores. The
continuous buy down is the drivizzg force behind volume
gains. The recent change to $6.50 per omen his}? down
gives us a greater acivamage over the comyeti‘cion thus
further increasing sales. However, with the lncreaseﬁ buy
down value, many accounts are now being identiﬁed as
having RER's EDLP Program. This may have a negative
impact on limiting our promotional support at retail for
Maverick brands The two Box 100‘s packings are
experiencing sales growth as distribution and awareness are
new at higher levels. Maverick is now ﬁrmly esﬁablished
as the #2 or #3 overall brané in the inner city of Atlanta.
Menthol Box EGG is now a power brand in urban Atlanta

All box packings continue to enjoy substantial overall
growih. The Lights Box packings continue to experience
distribution and awareness increases. Much of the Light
Box growth is coming ﬁom outside the Newport family.
Newport is maintaining its market position despite
competitive programs and the recent impact of the price

Marlboro Lights Box

In addition to the two highly—developed Marlboro Lights markets
(Minneapolis and Phoenix) that we suggested as test areas for
Marlboro Lights Box, we would also recommend conducting the test
in a below average Marlboro Lights market. We have found that
a number of the weaker Marlboro Lights markets are also strong
box areas. As such, a box packing in these markets may compli-

ment the soft pack and improve the overall performance of the
Lights‘ packings.

We would suggest New Orleans as a test market for this purpose.
The pertinent information on this area is attached.

Heater Development:

- PM 50 and PM 80 were received and tested for heater creep. We saw no signiﬁcant improvement of
mechanical stability under heating. ORNL is looking into their ability to enhance the stability by heat
treating. In addition, we are trying our own tests using ovens available at R&D.

changes in temperature) while maintaining the required heat transfer to the cigarette (thus maintaining
subjective character). We have identiﬁed the required energy proﬁle to attain a constant temperature for a

- Ceramx sleeve testing is in progress. The sleeves are functioning as expected.

RE: ' TRUE IMAGE STUDY —— Psychographic Analysis

This memo should serve to further explain the specifics of the
psychographic lifestyle clustering we will be utilizing in the
is being used here on an experimental basis due to a limited
working knowledge of its usefulness in this area (there is
little historical data on this subject which can be used for
comparison), and because of the relatively small sample size in
this study. We are hopeful, though, that the incorporation of
the lifestyle clusters can further enhance the analysis and
provide additional direction for the agency‘s purposes.

As you know, the lifestyle clusters are derived from a series
of sequential steps beginning with the self—administered list
of statements which the respondent rates in terms of how well
the statement describes him/her. The particular list we are
using in this study is a general one with no smoker-related
items and was supplied by an outside expert who has vast
experience with psychographics. It is our feeling that this
general list is sufficient for our purposes at this time.

The next step in the sequence is the utilization of a factor
analysis which will group items that correlate together across
the sample of respondents into five or six groupings which we
will label as "Quality Consciousness“, "Conservatism",
groups people that correlate together for their rating of the
items or for demographic profiles (such as older/younger).

Assuming that the groupings we get are able to discriminate,
the technique will provide us with an additional area of
analysis of our potential market — their lifestyle
characteristics - in addition to demographics.

Lou,

We need samples of displays by as early next week as
possible. I know you provided some of these but since the Elan
packs are thinner (like Capri) you recommended resizing them.

Also we need displays for incentive offers, I just wanted you to


— Set sell displays (slanted) for 20 horizontal and 20 and
30 vertical.

- Two with Incentive - Incentive will be a carded lighter

with packs of Elan. I don't have the final lighter yet

but will early next week. Offer will be available in two
sizes, 20 and 40 deal.

— A-l On-Carton - No final incentive here either, but
should be done next week. This will be a 30 deal display
only.

Based on cost input from you and Lee Payne, we are taking
another look at the stationery and pre-booking form. We will
have those back to you in a few weeks.

Please call if you have any questions.

Brief descriptions of the project activities for November 1999 are shown below.

Project Name (#): Testing Program (H-414)
Project Initiation Date: 1980

Project Hours: 99 A


Project Description: Potential tobacco ﬂavoring materials will be subjected to an extensive
review of the toxicology literature before they are approved for use. Based on this review, some
materials may be entered into a battery of toxicological screening tests which will be contracted
to commercial laboratories. The project requires extensive record keeping, external study
monitoring, documentation and report evaluation. Personnel from the Organic Chemistry,

Analytical Development, and Product Development groups will be utilized periodically to
provide specialized analyses. '

MEMORANDUM

 

TO: Executive Committee

FR: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.:EEEE§3**'

Today the Senate Finance Committee conducted%its third and
final day of hearings on revenue options. The hearing was
chaired for most of the time by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT);
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) attended for just a short
period of time. Other Senators in attendance included Thomas
Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and John Chafee (R-RI). The witness
list and selected testimony are attached.

 

Highlights include:

AFL-CIO, opposed any new or expanded sales, excise, or other
consumption taxes. "It is our strong belief that any new
revenues be raised on the basis of ability to pay," Oswald
said, adding, "regressive taxes are contrary to the goal of
tax justice and intent of Congress in enacting the 1986
reforms." Oswald encouraged the Committee "to focus its
estate and gift tax."

0 Paul Huard, Vice President, Taxation and Fiscal Policy,
National Association of Manufacturers, opposed any changes to
individual or corporate taxes or selectively imposed excise
taxes. "We oppose without exception any change that would
increase federal revenues derived from selectively-imposed
excise taxes," he said. Huard characterized excise taxes as
determined to raise additional federal tax revenues, it
uniform rate on the broadest possible base of taxable goods

andiservices."

SUBJECT: PROMOTIONS — True Carton Cash Continuity Program

 

 

Please ﬁnd attached the latest topline review of the True Carton Cash Continuity Program from
October 1 1th through October 22“. Also ﬁnd included the response analysis chart.

The number of cartons produced for this offer was 1,745,000. The original response projection
for this program was 11% and would have resulted in 16,000 coupon requests, or the submission
of 192,000 cash pieces. Response to this program continues to be very good. As of October
22nd, we had received a total of 257,016 cash pieces from consumers, resulting in 21,418 free
carton coupon requests. The response rate currently stands at 14.7%. Actual results have
exceeded the original projection by a considerable amount.

Of the requests we received, 90% derived from the True ﬁlter packings and 10% from Menthol.
Also of note, 36% of the respondents smoke 20 to 29 cigarettes per day. 27% of the respondents
smoke over 40 cigarettes a day and 17% smoke from 30 to 39. 13% did not specify.

Also ﬁnd enclosed the True Carton Cash Projected Response chart. This chart shows the original
projection and the revised projection for this program and how they compare with the actual
surpassed the October projection (21,215).

Upon your review of these reports, please contact me with any questions or if additional
information is required.

Cigarette Brand Shares — July 1980

July's Industry sales were off 4.3% versus 1979 (— 6.3% calendar
adjusted) due to a price increase last year. Likewise, reflecting the
levels, and 1.4% behind when calendar adjusted. Year—to-date comparisons
through August are expected to be more representative of the Industry's

Philip Morris (30.9) recorded a slight decline for the month, as did
Brown & Williamson (13.6). R.J. Reynolds (32.7), affected by the
combination of the discontinuation of Winston Menthol 100's, Salem Box,
Real and Tempo, and the national introduction of Salem Ultras, had

a small increase. American (10.7) and Lorillard (9.8) also gained some
share. Liggett & Myers (2.3) remained unchanged.

Among the leading brands, Marlboro (17.7) retreated from last month's
high. Declines were also evident in Winston (13.2) and K001 (8.9).

Salem (9-1) enjoyed the largest increase due to the launch of Salem
Ultras (0.6). Other gainers included Merit (4.3), Kent (5.0) and Camel
(4.3). B & H 100's (4.4), Pall Mall (5.2) and Vantage (3.7) held steady.

The Low Tar category tar level groups (Chart 6) have been revised from
0-5mg. and 6-9mg., to O—6mg. and 7—9mg., respectively, to include Vantage
Ultra Low Tar category.

The Low Tar category (41.5) surged in July aided by new Salem Ultra.

Low Tar 80/85‘5 (24.3), Low Tar IOU/120's (17.3) and Menthol Low Tar (13 0)
all registered share increases. The Non—Menthol Low Tar category (28.6)

was unchanged. Among the recent new Low Tar entries, Cambridge and Now 100's

recorded .3 shares, and Carlton 100‘s Box had a .1 share.

Of the other major categories, Total Menthol (28.9) and Total 100's (31.8)
increased. Total 80/85‘5 (58.1) declined slightly.

Subject: . B&H Kingll

At the March 13 meeting of the Benson and Hedges Task Force, I said I wouid
Took into the demographics of smokers of 80-855 who do not smoke our brands.
I don’t think there is anybody in the company more enthusiastic than I about

the prospect of a B&H King (especiaiiy a menthoi), and I have been pushing
the idea at every opportunity for three or four years. Having said that, I

have to add a caveat: We have to be carefui that we don’t shoot ourseives
in the foot. We aiready own a good share of the nonmenthoi 80-85 market.
Who §mokes Our Brands?

First a Tittie background information. Figure 1 shows the totai number of
smokers, and the number who smoke a Phiiip Morris brand, by age of smoker
and by Tength and type (menthoi or nonmenthoi of cigarette. For a1] four
Tength-type categories, caagéQ-i?;?iﬁ" TTLL ti igBeSEJiﬁﬁﬁﬁTEﬁETyﬁﬁﬁgéStl
smokers and decTines with age. Cieariy this is the best position to be in,
since there is a tendency for peopie toxstick'within a brand name. This,
combined with the increase in the absoiute number of 18—34 year-oids from
1964 to 1984, is what fueied our growth in market share.

  

Figure 2 shows the totai number of smokers of nonmenthoi 80-855 and the
number who smoke one of our brands, by age, sex, and race. Figure 3 shows
the same data for menthois. I have deiiberateiy put them both on the same
scaie to show the reiative importance of menthois and nonmenthois among the
various groups. Femaies are much more iikeiy than maies to smoke 100-1205,
and, among maies, biacks are more Tikeiy than whites to smoke 100-1205 up to
age 40, when the reverse becomes true. That expTains the sex differences in
the number of smokers of kings, and some of the race differences. Aiso, as

SUBJECT! 'MINUTES'OF MARCH 10, 1982 P.D.C. MEETING

The following paragraphs summarize our discussions:

1. SALES REVIEW - Our 1981 experience with the A.I.D. program‘
and a comparison of it with the newly announced Philip Morris
program were discussed. Other competitive activities reviewed
included Brown and Williamson‘s Plan I Bonus program and
additional give-aways;_R. J. Reynold's seemingly endless spending
spree including the 10% bonus for exclusive Plan II's, the K—Mart

exclusive pack sales deal, and increased payments for out-of-
home.

2. ESTABLISHED BRANDS - Advertising flighting schedules for all
brands were rev1ewed. The decision to promote NEWPORT RED in
two, rather than the previously-announced six markets, was an-
nounced; as was the upgrading of Florida, Texas, and California
to core status on NEWPORT parent later this year. Also reviewed
were the new promotion plans for parent KENT utilizing the
spring-summer-fall events.

Discussions on TRUE centered‘mainly on the application of the
laser technology and-the apparent success of the new marketing

-activities. The GOLDEN LIGHTS ULTRA and MAX SLIM LIGHTS projects

were reviewedu

3. NEW BRANDS — Heritage has been withdrawn from the Jackson

market; support will continue in Lexington where a 0.47% S.O.M.
currently exists. REBEL continues to perform very well in Erie
and fair in Roanoke. Possibilities of a box packing and also a
metro area test will be two topics for discussion at the "next—

steps" meeting to be held in three or four weeks. An up-date is
attached.

The SATIN CONCEPT/PRODUCT TEST results were reviewed and
everything looks extremely promising for this brand.

Ra APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION: CARLTON ASSAULT W-3 EXPANSION

 

The following proposal recommends funding an expansion of
the CARLTON Assault effort to Section W—3. Total estimated
costs are $1,920,000.

BACKGROUND

The CARLTON Assault is a fully integrated effort with all
the key elements (Advertising, Direct and Promotion)

focused to create maximum pressure against the retail
environment and competitive smokers. It is a swift and
powerful program designed to build business and capture new
share.

The Assault program is a strategic tool reserved for highly
developed growth opportunity areas —— success breeds

success. To achieve full impact, we continue to believe a
full year of activity is required. Thereafter, the Assault

Section W—3 is our strongest CARLTON area with a 145 SDI
(2.29 share). W—3 represents 6.64% of population and, more
importantly, 9.61% of CARLTON sales.

W-3 is also scheduled to participate in the 1992 Future
Bold expansion which will provide added S/O support.


MSA, which covers the entire store universe, is showing a

positive CARLTON share trend. Due to shipment volatility,

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.
INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

To: Dr. C. L. Ellis \ Date: August 25, 1998
From: A. I. Goldsmith x\~

«

When Merit was launched in 1976, part of the promotional activities included a whirlwind tour by Dr.
Ikeda touting the scientiﬁc breakthrough that enabled the creation of a low delivery cigarette with a
full ﬂavor taste; other researchers also spoke to the press, including Bill Dunn, Walt Gannon, and Hel-
mut Wakeham. Based on the news reports —- some of which are enclosed —- I pieced together a possi-
ble sequence to account for a reference to nine years of research in light of the fact that the quest for
a ﬂavorful low tar cigarette goes back at least to 1958 [C58—00972; 1]. Actually, most news stories say

twelve years, which probably dates to the 1964 Surgeon General’s report. Interestingly, however,
C75-01560 lists HTI test codes for high burley blends similar to the Timer blend so as to be able to
substantiate claims that work had been continuing for seven years.
It would appear that Dr. Ikeda’s clock started ticking at about the time a research program began at

Philip Morris ﬁrst got involved with llTRl in 1965 [C65-03108], when looking into electrostatic ﬁlters.l
Then in 1968, along with Airkem, Armour & Company. Gillette, Givaudan, Glidden-Durkee, S. C.
Johnson & Company, Lever Brothers, Procter & Gamble, Rexall Chemicals, and Vick Chemical, Phi-
lip Morris began jointly sponsoring a research program on odor characterization and measurement
headed by Andrew Dravnieks. Progress reports from IITRI [2-12] refer to olt‘actometers, and of course
gas chromatography was relied upon heavily. both of which correspond with the terminology in
Ikeda’s presentations. When the initial three year program concluded, Philip Morris signed on as a
co-sponsor of a two year follow—up program.

More signiﬁcantly, Philip Morris assisted in a study on the determination of odor components in
tobacco smoke, which was sponsored by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Con-
ditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Phase I [9 and 13] found GC peaks correlating with likely contributors
to tobacco odor, and Phase 11 used mass spectrometry to identify most of the constituents [11].
Although the commercial cigarettes used were Winston, Philip Morris provided 1R1 Reference
Cigarettes for use: some cigars and pipe tobaccos also were studied. In addition, PM R&D experts
Phase III geared to creating a tobacco odor simulant for room ventilation studies by mixing the most
important constituents identiﬁed in Phase II, but I have not found a copy of a Phase III report.
The Phase II report is signiﬁcant, because later in 1974 one sees the ﬁrst indications in internal docu-
mentation of the identiﬁcation of odor-intense smoke constituents with the goal of using some to add
ﬂavor to a low delivery product [IR74-089 and C75—05631}. The major discontinuity in this sequence
is that IITRI’s compounds seem to relate more to room odor or even to stale odor than to the ﬂavorful
odor of fresh mainstream smoke. The urgency of Project Timer seems to have left little time for writ—
ten documentation other than in laboratory notebooks, so it is difﬁcult to determine how, when, and by

' Probably because the Surgeon General‘s Report discussed the charge on smoke particles.

SUBJECT: Revised Project Schedules
Mr. Judge recently directed us to alter the timing on three -
projects: (1) True 100's tar reduction, (2) KGL 100's .
tar reduction, and (3) Aspen. We have revised the project
schedules to accomodate his requests and the following

paragraphs will summarize the revised schedule and their

impact on the remaining projects.

I. TRUE lOO'S TAR REDUCTION

According to our prior schedule, this project would have
been completed by 1-1-79 except for Market Research
which was not scheduled. Mr. Judge has directed

that we be in market on 1-1-79. We have one can—

didate (same taste) ready and will select another
candidate (True 5 taste) for Market Research. The
revised schedule follows:

(1) Make MRD samples 9 October 1978
(2) 'Ship MRD samples 20 October 1978
(3) Samples arrive in N.Y. 23 October 1978
(4) TDp Line results 20 November 1978
(5) Test Mkt. Prod. Start 27 November 1978
(6) Test Market Sales 2 January 1979

In order to meet the schedule, we must have all approved
artwork in hand and order all materials (tipping, labels,
etc.) needed on 16 October 1978.

This project was originally budgeted at 2300 man-hours

(of which 1860 were budgeted in 1978) excluding Market

Research sample preparation, evaluation, and production
monitoring. The new schedule allows for 1375 man—hours
in total. '

INVESTIGATION OF SMOKE AEROSOL


.—-—

W

PART VII

February 1266

A characteristic property of smoke
aerosol droplets is their ability under certain
conditions to separate into two virtually distinct
phases. In most of our work to date we have
devoted our attention to the use of screens and
methods of collection that avoided this separation,
because we were hoping to get information bearing
on the aerosol particles as they actually are in
the free state. Even when we found that passage
through a carbon filter increased the tendency of
the droplets to spread we endeavoured to use screens
which limited this to spreading of the droplet as a
whole and stopped short of phase separation.

We discussed "spreading" in some detail
on pp. 7, 8, and 9. of our report PART V. April 1965,
and we include at Plate I. of that report a
reproduction of a photograph showing what we there
termed "a typical case of advanced spreading". In
this case the spreading was due to the aerosol
having passed through a charcoal filter. We have
now carried out some further experiments which%
while preliminary, suggest how this phenomena might
be further investigated. 4

Subject: Media Begueet -- QAPI [AL (Franeet

As you‘ll remember from my previous memo, Eric Wattez, a

interview you sometime between September 2-15 or after

Baekgreund:

Qapital, is the leading French economic / business magazine. It is
published by the Prisma Group and has ties with the German
group, Gruener 8: Iahr, which publishes the German edition of

The French Qapital was introduced in October 1991 and met with
immediate success. It surpassed the then-leading French economic
monthly, L'ﬂxpmeign. Today, Capital's circulation has reached
almost 300,000.
Qapital employs somewhat unusual angles: it tries to 'humanize'
its stories, making the economy and business readable and
appealing to everybody.
Qapital normally devotes one 5 to 6 page story to a large company
which is in the news because of its success (or failure.) Mr. Wattez

is preparing such a story on PM -- as an example of success. He
has already interviewed Walter Thoma (President, EC), Michael

Horst (EC) and Ray Viault (Jacobs Suchard). He has also seen PM
sponsorship in action by attending the Monaco Formula 1 Grand

Prix.

It is clear that public attention to many tobacco issues will be
high this month. In addition to the surgeon general's report,
the American Medical Association is planning a "Tobacco Use in

Capital Appropriation Request
Fabriques de Tabac Reunies (Switzerland)

— New Research and Development Building at Neuchatel
Authority Requested

Philip Morris International requests approval from the Board of
Directors for Fabriques de Tabac Reunies to spend SF 20,097,000
(U.S. $12,180,000) for the design, construction and installation
of laboratory equipment and furniture for a new Research and
Development building in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Previously
authorized expenditures of SF 600,600 (0.5. $367,000) for engi—
neering study and design are included in the above figure.

Background _

The proposed Research and Development center in Neuchatel will. _
provide services for.the’entire_European Region“as local affil— ”
in European production (from 76.8 billion cigarettes in 1979 to
157.6 billion.in 1984), the development of new brands and the
addition of new technology will require greater and more complex
services from the R&D Department in the future.

The R&D Department currently employs 121 people located in six
separate buildings providing total area of 24,866 square feet.
Three of these buildings are rented outside the main FTR manufac-
turing complex. The physical decentralization of the R&D function
is believed by management to have a negative impact on current

and potential performance, particularly in light of the projected

Proposal

After consideration of the available alternatives, local management
recommends construction of the new building and elimination of four
of the six buildings presently in use. This will centralize the
R&D Department in the manufacturing complex. The building will
have four floors and provide 38,800 gross square feet and 20,700
square feet of laboratory and office space. It will accommodate

the building will be constructed to allow for further expansion if
required. When combined with the two existing buildings to be

NEW BRAND DEVELOPMENT

SHF/UHF — Top—line results from quantitative concept evaluation
indicate that "50% lower nicotine" has strong potential. We

are starting product and advertising development on this concept.
This, along with business/marketing planning, is aimed toward

a 1/77 test market. We plan to select 3 or h more concepts

from analysis of the complete data (including - for sure — one
menthol SHF concept) during the week of 8/23.

Nowland‘s first report on their basic work with health—concerned
smokers will be made in late August. Their work will be com—
pleted in late 1976. We plan to select from Nowland ideas and
mid—1977 and beyond.

Perceived Economy — Twelve concepts are being produced for
quantitative evaluation. Top—line results will be available

in early October. We plan to be in—market with low technology
Synectics II — Work is proceeding on major projects:

— MRD will shortly recommend how we can best
identify (quantify) high—potential cigarette
smoking segments; who, why, how many. This
is likely to be a long—range study - but we
will separate it into manageable,specific
building steps.

PARLIAMENT MENTHOL ADZPACK STUDY - TOPLINE
BACKGROUNDZMETHOD

This memo summarizes the topline results of the Parliament
Menthol Ad/Pack research. A detailed report will‘be~

available in late July.
Interviewing was undertaken in twelve northeastern cities
among 404 menthol smokers and 102 young (18—24 years)
Parliament smokers who occasionally smoke menthol
cigarettes. The menthol smokers were broken out into the
following groups: ‘

o 147 full flavor king size smokers
o 161 flavor low king size smokers
o 96 female flavor low 100’s smokers

The following points highlight the topline findings:

0 with the exception of the female 100's smokers,
Parliament Menthol did not appear to generate interest
at the concept stage. Specifically, only one in ten of
they would "definitely buy" the brand.

0 However, after trial, "definite" purchase interest
levels doubled among both the king size and franchise
smokers so that all four smoker groups exhibited
similar levels of interest.

2. General methods identiﬁed in existing patents and literature.

3. The impact of cigarette dilution on smoke component concentrations.

American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in
Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August.
The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and

at generic prices in Shreveport.

Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California

Misty Slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport
(Generic Priced) and increased one-tenth in Bakersfield
(Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period.

Similar to when last reported, the share difference
between the two markets appears to be due to the higher
levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81%
of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion
versus 20% in Shreveport.

Bakersfield’s incentives include BlGlF’s, $3 off carton
purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and
free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase.
The pantyhose with carton purchase and BlGlF's continue
to be reported in Shreveport’s outlets. In addition,
only one store offered the free magazine with carton
promotion in the generic priced market.

For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has

WPA MEETING HELD IN HAMBURG ON JUNE 14 1989

Participants : Adlkofer (VDC), Klus (AUS), Kausch (BAT),
Fink (PMG), Beecken (PMG), Dembach (RJR),
Konig (VDC)

Industry Research Concept/Research Council Smoking & Health

The term of office of the 4th Research Council expires in 1990.
WPA discussed considerations on the re—formation and research
objectives of the future Research Council. There was unanimity
that the Research Council in its existing composition and
objectives is defined too narrowly for the current problems and
that therefore the remit of the next Research Council should be
formulated more widely and not only specifically tobacco industry
oriented. There was also unanimity on the fact that the existing
period of office of the Research Council of 3 years is too short.
There were adverse comments by WPA on the legal status of a
foundation, introduced into the discussion by Prof. A.

A working group dealing with the future Research Council and
consisting of Messrs Wille (PMG), Konig (VDC), Herter (BAT) and
Wieckmann (REE) came, at its first meeting, to the conclusion that
the person of Prof. Thurau is of particular importance in the
formation of the next Research Council.


 

A paper about the 1990 Research Council, elaborated by U. Beecken
and VV. Fink for G. Wille, regards the elaboration (If the
scientific principle of the importance of endogenic exposure vs.

To: The Members of the Executive Committee

From: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. 232:2):

Today, by a vote of 8—7, the Los'Angeles City Council rejected a
smoking ban in restaurants in favor of a more reasonable smoking
restriction measure. The phased—in ordinance proposal would
nonsmokers for two years. Then, the nonsmoker seating would be
increased to 70 percent. Signs stating, "smoking is permitted in
this establishment" must be posted on restaurant exteriors;

 

This measure now goes to the City Attorney for redrafting. The
new draft will be returned to the City Council for a final vote,
probably within the next 60 days. The mayor must then sign the

measure into law. We have no indication that he will not sign
this ordinance.

While we are not yet completely out of the woods in L.A., I know
you join me in congratulating everyone who has been involved in
this effort. As you know, we have pulled out all the stops to
prevent a ban. I am very pleased by the outstanding teamwork
that has taken place. The effort to date has been extensive,
complex and complete. That complete industry effort will
continue in the same vein throughout the process.

FROM: Ralph Atlas

SUBJECT: LORILLARD SHELF PLAN REVISION

 

Attached is a copy of Lorillard's new carton shelf payment
schedule effective June 1, 1985.

The changes are as follows:

the payment was $119.00.

0 The lowest volume category (100-199) has been eliminated.

o In stores having only one standard fixture, "one full shelf"
is interpreted as either 12 or 16 rows per shelf, however,
in stores with multiple racks, "one full shelf" must
represent 16 rows, with extra rows being contiguous.

The purpose is to upgrade Lorillard's position in all stores when
correspondence states that "if a retailer adamantly objects to
giving Lorillard the required additional rows, do not jeopardize
the arrangement -- we will grandfather those ocations."

Without using the tagline, however, allows consumers to draw their own conclusions
about the brand, like a great quality product or “a brand of cigarettes that’s for me”.

Additionally, photos of Maverick packs will be featured on all pieces that are intended

In regard to the fluted Parliament 100 tip, our discussion

more details about the cutter designs used on the dual

combiner and cigaret assembler. I referred him to Manufacturing
for details;

Dr. Hansermann stated that FTR was extremely interested in
getting ou+ an entirely new product and it was his feehing that
the flush fhuted filter could provide the basis for such a
cigaret. I showedlhim the extrusion process and hater dis-
cussedithe benefits to he derived when this type filter was
used in combination with a carbon on tow inner plug, e.g.,
Philip Morris Multifilter type. Dr. Haﬁsermann indicated

that FTR would probabhy be interested in purchasing an
extrusionlline. I obtained from Gatto the name of their German
subsidiary from which equipment, identical to ours, could be
purchased. (Later in the day Dr. Seligman‘suggestedlthat FTR
might be able/to arrange a transfer of one of Manufacturingis
extrusion lines to Switzerland and then order another line

for themselves. He suggested Dr. Waltz explore this possibihity
through proper company channels.) If they do obtain a line

He felt that cooling the material on a belt containing molds
of the same basic configuration as our quartz tubes was a good

“ ‘SUBJECT: Carolina 30's positioning

'———————————nr—wmm———~-—_———-———~——————_———--mu~—_--—————~-—————u——

This will summarize some thoughts coming out of yesterday‘s‘

These excellent focus groups will undoubtedly give us further
important direction. However, the major benefit for me was

their overall positioning guidance — what to communicate and
‘f (especially) what not to communicate.
 

We are moving very, very fast. And as we move forward over
these early positioning thoughts. However, for now this

positioning gives us the necessary focus against which to
make changes.

Positioning Thoughts

What Helps — 1. Every group has voiced surprise, ”shock"
at how good the product tastes. Of course we‘ll make final

determinations and modifications based on product testing.
But this reaction is sure nice to see.

2. Thirty cigarettes (10 extra, pack and a half) is very
positive to many respondents. thile taste is important

("ten extra what"), this added quantity is our uniqueness,
and will be very important to trial.

3. Good taste and low tar is an important, unsatisfied
need for many smokers. Relative to Carolina 30's, we

particularly saw this in the second session yesterday.

4. Although not explicitly probed, the brand name
Carolina 30's seems to work well. I believe it brings

assurance, credibility and good taste overtones to this
new brand.

Administrative Law Judge Vitonne yesterday presided over the
Administration’s (OSHA) scheduled 11-week hearings on the
proposed indoor air quality standard. OSHA staff testified in

the morning; the balance of the day was consumed by a cross—
examination period.

Agency's intent to use the information obtained at the hearing to
"assure that the final rule is effective." Noting that ETS
issues had received a disproportionate amount of pre-hearing
attention, Silverstein stressed that tobacco is only one of many
airborne "hazards" OSHA would address in the final rule. He
denied any political motivation for the rulemaking.

John Martonik, acting director of health standards programs for
OSHA, stressed that the regulation would not ban smoking, but
only restrict smoking to separately exhausted smoking areas under
negative pressure so that nonsmoking coworkers are "protected ...
4.4 million buildings and 70.7 million workers would be affected

Rationale for this direction is discussed below. Rich's

begins to sketch out the new plan.

 

Brand developed a plan to increase competitive conversion and restore
Lights growth trend in the current test markets. While the plan
would likely achieve these objectives, full costing out of the

programs discloses a spending level so high as to raise serious
questions about expandability and projectability of results. This

factor, combined with several strategic issues outlined below, lead
us to a recommendation to abandon development of the Phase I]: plan in

A. Chemical Evaluation

1. The LTF-IIDF formulation whose whole smoke conden-
sate compared favorably to that of IIA has been modified further
at the request of the Chemical Research Group (6908). One of

these modifications was that of IIJF which is a similar material
to IIDF but without humectant.

The whole smoke condensate of IIJF was then compared
to that of IIDF; and based on the correlation of Grimmer
fractions 11, III and IV with activity, the order of relative
of fraction II is greater than 90% in both cases.

2. It was decided to test LTF-IIJF further and the
production of 15,000 pounds of this material is scheduled to
begin at the BL Pilot Plant on September 22.

B. Smoking Evaluations

l. A range of low tar fiblerS‘(LTF-IIDF, IIEF, IIJF
and‘IIICF) possessing similar subjective characteristics, varying
tar deliveries, and significantly lower C0 values (7-9‘mg/cigt)
were developed and screened.

2. The blend and flavor development studies were
continued‘with 50 and 75% LTF-IIDF in the blend.

3. The use of a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts
of the low molecular weight organic acids (Cl-Clp) with LTF-IIDF
formulation produced an acceptable mainstream/sidestream smoke
at the 50 and 75% levels.

4. The role of sheet foaming on tar and CO deliveries
is now being investigated with foamed/unfoamed LTF-IID and IIIB.

SUBJECT: Newport 10's Update
Following is an update of the 10's test in Detroit and the South
Bronx. In addition, the progress on further testing is detailed.

Background

A Newport 10's pack program was placed in stores in the South
Bronx the week of 6/02 and in Detroit the week of 5/25. The 10's
packs were placed in temporary displays with p.o.s. support

The perceived benefit to consumers was an out-of-pocket cost
advantage, thereby serving as a trial device for the Brand.

Spanish population. RJR audits indicate a 9% S.O.M. for Newport
box, second in share to Marlboro box. New York tax laws require
a tax stamp on the 10's which was affixed by the jobber at a cost
of $1.25 per thousand units. In this area 4 of the original 10
test stores were replaced due to excessive pilferage. This had
resulted in our displays being removed from the counter by store
owners.

‘ In Detroit, total Newport Green has a share of 4.60% (12 months
through 9/82). Logistically, this test was easier as taxes are
paid by the jobber off invoices. Fourteen stores were tracked in
the Detroit panel. After July 23rd however, data on only 5
stores was tracked due to stores dropping from the panel and 1

Virginia Slims Ultra Lights

This report updates Virginia Slims Ultra Lights most recent performance
in the Memphis and San Francisco test markets. Several data sources
will be referenced in order to provide a thorough analysis: Factory
Shipments, ICC, Retail Audits, and SPACE. Factory shipments were
initiated 1/22/87 with availability at retail effective 2/27/87.

Memphis

Shipment data reflect that Virginia Slims Ultra Lights registered a 0.6
S.0.M. based on recent four week period ending 5/15/87. Share was
virtually evenly distributed with Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Regular
displaying a 0.27 share and Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Menthol
contributing 0.31 share points.

At the distributor level, the brand's 4 week rolling averages have
continually grown, currently residing at a 0.8 level (w/e 4/24) --
equivalent to shipment data at that point in time.

Retail data, reflecting a 50 store panel located in the Memphis trading
area, are positioned at the 1.5 level based on the recent four week
period ending 4/26. The Ultra Light Regular and Menthol levels were
basically equal exhibiting a respective 0.7 and 0.8 S.0.M. The Ultra
Low Tar line extension currently attains a similar share in pack outlets
(S.0.M: 1.6) compared to performance in carton outlets (S.0.M: 1.4)
based on the current four week period. While the retail share data in
this report appear to be overstated in the two test markets, these
levels are at parity with share of smoker data reported by Consumer
Research, derived from a survey during week 10 after introduction.

In the audit panel, Virginia Slims Ultra had a distribution level of
83% for the two week period ending 4/13 -- down -7 versus the prior two
weeks. 0f the 83% carrying, 5% reported being completely 00S of the
brand. During the next two weeks, distribution increased to the 86%


SPACE continues to report an availability of 85% as of w/e 5/08/87 -- at
parity with the audit panel.

Package sales are still growing in Urban Special Emphasis Calls. The
Menthol packings are now becoming ﬁrmly established, and the 100 MM
packings are becoming the best sellers overall. We continue to enjoy an
average 10¢ price advantage in most retail outlets vs. Doral and GPC.

The Box packings continue to grow throughout the area. In many cases
Newport Box Parent outsells Newport Soft. Newport Light Box 80's
continue to experience excellent increases in sales and distribution. Most
retailers are maintaining larger inventories which aids in excellent
increased competitive trial. The Light Box 100's are also beneﬁting from
renewed trial.

Each of these brand families continue to decline in sales with the
exception of the Kent Heavy-Up in Region 17. This program allows Kent
to maintain sales.

Sales in Region 25 have decreased dramatically due to the elimination of
promotional support. Retailers report there are some brand loyal
consumers who are continuing to purchase the hrand without a coupon.
Clean-Up Program achieved our objectives, and the buy-down in the

This document will outline a Labor Management Committee state tax
strategy for the remainder of 1990 and 1991. The strategy is
based upon the information provided us in the October 1990
"Cigarette Excise Legislation Priority 1 States" document.
In order to shape the state excise tax debate and influence its
outcome, the LMC will utilize and access existing resources as
well as develop new contacts where possible. Among the resources
available to the Committee are:

- LMC member unions
- non-LMC labor organizations with which the Committee has
working relationships
- LMC state labor consultants

- citizens for Tax Justice
- fair tax/citizen action groups which the Committee
supports

A Fair Tax Message

In virtually each state, it will be essential to frame the debate
as one of fair versus unfair tax policy. By expanding the
discussion beyond cigarette excise taxes, the Committee will be
greater chance of success.

In order to achieve this goal, the Committee will look to the

I am well aware of this organization and can readily endorse
it mainly by its reputation. I, personally, have never
attendedy the PTC meetings, but those who have speak highly
of the work and objectives of this group. This Institute
investigates various problems in the field of intellectual

Washington University enhances the Institute' 5 ability to
attract qualified persons to conduct the necessary studies

The DuPont Company actively supports this endeavor and Samuel
Lenher, a DuPont vice president, is on its advisory council.
I am not certain which other companies support the Institute,
but I would imagine companies such as G.E., IBM, Monsanto,
etc., which have large patent programs are contributorsi If
you would like a list of contributors, I believe I couldlget

one for you.

The work of this Institute is worthwhile and my recommendation
would be for Philip Morris to support the PTC Institute. I
would think the minimum amount of $500 to be a participating

Subject: .Nicotine Overspray

Enclosed please find a draft of the Job Safe Procedure for the over—
spray of nicotine on cut filler or like material. In accordance with our
previous discussions and with your approval, we developed this procedure for
your explosion—proof room in Semiworks. We feel this offers several
advantages to the small scale room previously considered. One is the
obvious increase in safety from fire or explosion. In addition, it is more
isolated from other work and we feel the drying can be done in the same room
to avoid transporting the tobacco outside.

through to the adjacent room (primary) to install the spray unit control
system which is not spark-proof. A window is to be added to the door of the
explosion— proof room (not to exceed 100 sq.in.) to allow visual contact
with the inside worker and the spray cylinder operation. This will allow
the door and the hole drilled through the wall can be properly sealed to
maintain the explosion proof integrity of the room. K.H. Cho and Mike
Penn are arranging to install a Class A, Division I (spark—proof)
cylinder rotating motor with belt drive instead of chain drive and an
airline lockout system for added safety. We simply need to ensure that the
electrical conduit used for installation meets the same criteria.

This procedure is now scheduled to use nicotine free.base dissolved
in ethanol instead of nicotine citrate. Our procedure was written to cover
both contingencies.
7, 1989. We plan to spray filler with alcohol first - as a "dry run" for
our procedure and for use as a control sample for the research. Then we
intend to spray one batch of filler with nicotine at the 2.15% loading level
with many samples taken to help define the hazards and safety precautions
necessary. Extra safety precautions will be taken during this first run
of the analysis data and the experience of handling the tobacco produced.
The room may be needed all week.

The remaining three sprayings scheduled are to be done August 14, 1989

Thursday; June 30 is cause for concern on many different levels“

One of the:more serious aspects of the legislation is that
affecting the (banned) use of cigarette‘brandtnames in the type
of promotional activities normally used to build and reinfOrce
sporting events such‘as a recent Kent putting contest in Phoenix,
etc.

The legislation does, however, permit use of a corporate name; a
decidedledge for the more well known Philip Morris and RJR.
Now is the time for Lorillard to build‘greater awareness of the
corporate name so that should it become necessary Ci.e; similar
legislation‘as that passed in Canada beingaenacted here) we could
stay competitve in promotional events.

Several vehicles for such a program could be considered: An
adVertising:"Quality" campaign not unlike Ford Motor Company's
"Quality is:Job 1" campaign; simply greater association of the
Lorillard name with branded products via a logo or slogan i.e.
all broadcast ads ﬁor agx of their products or, perhaps, the
investigation of the Lorillard name itself on a new brand such as
a potential breakthrough product (as in our Reduced Side Stream‘

If any of‘this sounds reasonable to you we could‘begdn by
equity.

Can we discuss further, at your convenience?

The membership of the 1993—1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee was generated by
consultation with R&D management and management outside R&D. Those listed have been
selected to serve on this committee. I hope to contact most of you by telephone before you receive
this memorandum to discuss with you the goals and plans of the committee. If I have not been
able to do so, please accept my apologies.

A meeting of the R&D Strategic PlanningCommittee will be held within the next one or
two weeks to begin our important work for the coming year. I realize how difﬁcult it is to
schedule meetings for such a large group, and the realities are that any individual cannot attend
each meeting we have during the year. However, I strongly urge you to attend the ﬁrst meeting

when possible for future meetings.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Patrick Donoho
V.P. Tobacco Institute


DATE: February 21, 1997

It was a pleasure talking with you about our mutual efforts to extend our clients
special interests thrOughout the United States. And, I appreciate the opportunity to tell
you abbot an exciting project we developed for the National Licensed Beverage
Association (NLBA). When we spoke, I mentioned that our ﬁrm has taken the lead, on

membership. The name of this project is Campaign 2000. Because of our contacts
within the hospitality industry, we have been very successful in our efforts to establish
new state afﬁliates. At the beginning of Campaign 2000 (July 1, 1995), the NLBA
represented 18 states. As of the ﬁrst of January ‘97, they represent 29 states. And, we
have 8 other states in various stages of the NLBA afﬁliation process. I’ll give you a run—

While we have added approximately 2,000 new members to the NLBA rolls, the
pace of our membership recruitment has been less than meteoric. As you can imagine,
people, but, understandably, no start-up funds. It’s a bit of a Catch-22 situation. Despite
my limited budget, I try to help where I can with brochures, literature and press releases.
Hewever, mailing lists, labels, postage, design work for state afﬁliate logo’s and
application forms, are often beyond the new state afﬁliates ﬁnancial capability.
While I expect the pace to Speed-up over the next several months, I remain concerned
that the organizing groups may not be in a position to fully exploit a recent development
that will make NLBA membership especially attractive to retailers who offer music (live
and mechanical), and/or television broadcasts.

FROM, Sandra Pecan ,47Q/

wuxm Summary of Leonard Zahn's Report on the American Heart
Association Annual Meeting, November 14-17, 1983
The American Heart Association held its annual meeting in
Anaheim, California, November 14-17, 1983. There was a record
turnout of physicians from around the country with more than
1,700 presentations. Press coverage was extensive, but the
smoking reports attracted little attention.

To further emphasize the smoking and heart disease issue, the
AHA had the Surgeon General's November 17 press conference.
piped into the press room. A statement was then issued by the
AHA on its reactions to the Surgeon General's report:

"Viewed over the long term, the cost in human
lives from continued smoking is staggering. As
many as 10% of all Americans now alive may die
prematurely of heart disease related to their
smoking behavior...this means 24 million premature
deaths due to smoking....The American Heart
Association pledges to continue unrelenting
efforts to make the American public more aware of
both the grievous dangers of smoking and the
cessation...."
According to Leonard Zahn, reporters from the major media left
coverage of the Surgeon General's report to their Washington
bureaus and paid little attention to the AHA's statement.

Highlights of the meeting follow:
SMOKING AS A RISK FACTOR

Aaron Folsom, Minneapolis, reported on a study that assessed

the use and‘possible health risks of low-yield cigarettes (15mg pg
or less of tar). Levels of serum thiocyanate (a metabolic CD
product of hydrogen cyanide which is in the gas phase of the Pi
main stream of cigarette smoke) and cigarette brands smoked CH
were determined in 2,561 adult smokers who were among 9,106 52
persons participating in two heart disease risk factor surveys ‘1
in seven upper midwestern communities from 1980 to 1982. ‘1
p
«1

Findings indicated that compared to 1980 data for the country
as a whole, a greater proportion of smokers in these

communities smoked low-yield brands. Low tar brands were more
popular with women than with men. There was no relationship

Alan Blum

It is somewhat difficult to give you anything deﬁnitive that Blum may
bring up at the shareholders meeting, but I'll attempt a stab.

anything. In the past, he has not been as combative as some of the
other anti's (certainly not like the Connolly's, Slade's et a1), and tries to
come across as a "good" guy, often complimenting PM on its hospitality
in Richmond, etc. I ﬁnd him more an irritant, attempting to
embarrass us, than, say, the institutional shareholders, who are
pushing for dramatic change. This will be his seventh annual meeting.

physicians' anti-tobacco group that is especially fond of protesting
tobacco-sponsored sporting groups. It targeted Virginia Slims
Tournament one year, calling it Emphysema Slims. DOC has been
trying to bring in religious allies to its cause.

Blum likes to twist or exaggerate things. He has accused us of
suborning the minority community. For example, he said the reason
Blacks rarely criticized the tobacco industry on smoking and health
issues was because we were "buying them off' with our charitable
Republican Convention, released our internal memoranda regarding
political contributions. At the time he tried to embarrass us by saying
as Convention Chairman, is further evidence of how we get to
politicians. If we support a youth organization, he‘ll say our ulterior
motive is really to get kids to smoke, or, if we sponsor a promotion,
he'll say we are really trying to circumvent restrictions on TV
advertising.

As far as I can recall, he has never put forward a shareholder
resolution, but has seconded or commented on many others. We
reviewed the transcripts of the past several years' annual meetings,
and he has seconded or commented on the following resolutions -
economic conversion (1994), cigarette advertising (1993), global
warning labels (1993/91), marketing of Miller beer (1992/91),
cigarettes and minors (1990). This year, I suspect he may be
interested in Proposal 2 - E’I‘S; maybe 3, primarily because it attempts
to get us out of the tobacco business; and 5, economic conversion,
since he seconded last year.

To: . Mr. T. M. Howell Date: September 5, 1989
Subject: . Justification for PVT System.

I recommend that a Ruska Vapor—Liquid Equilibrium System be purchased so
that we can perform, among others, the following experiments.

With this apparatus we will be able to isolate solubilized tobacco
components which condense from CO2 during depressurization.
Collection and analysis of the solubles in the CO2 phase will yield
phase equilibrium properties between the precipitate and the
tobacco matrix.

(2) CO2 - Nicotine equilibrium "bi,,, ”i iii. 7 r, .
This system will be used to measure the equilibrium properties of
this mixture beyond the present lower pressure data. The effect of
pressure and temperature on the activity of nicotine in CO2 can be
determined from these experiments.

(3) Solubility measurements above the current 4000 psi limitation to
10,000 psi. , . 4, ,,_
Presently we do not have any equipment to test Gahr’s patented
concept of using N2 and CO2 mixtures to selectively extract
the feasibility of this concept.

The Ruska PVT system is a mercury free variable volume system with a working
pressure of 10,000 psi. The heart of the apparatus is two independently
operated variable volume cells with a capacity of 400 and 600 ml. Each cell
considerations built into the system include a safety blow:out panel in the
rear door and a sapphire window oriented away from the operator. This
system will be located on the North wall of D—201 adjacent to the one—liter
system and will not involve major modifications to the laboratory. The
total cost of this system is $137,415. Quoted delivery is 5-6 months after
receipt of order although Ruska has said this can be reduced. Attached is a

quotation from Ruska and more detailed specificationiinformation.

This project was included in the 1989 Second Revised Capital Forecast for

$90,000, and it was included in the igg9—l993 Five—Year Plan.

1. Ammonia —- Ammonia is used as a processing aid in the production of cigarettes.
Greater than 95 percent of the ammonia is recovered for reuse. Only trace levels remain
listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by FDA for use in food, including ammonia
hydroxide, mono and dibasic ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate. ammonium
biocarbonate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium chloride (21 CPR. §§ 184.1135,
184.1137, 184.1138, 184.1139, 184.1141, 184.1143). Ammonia compounds are approved
for use in tobacco by the Independent Scientiﬁc Committee on Smoking and Health (the
Hunter Committee) in the United Kingdom. ‘ Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance
that is produced endogenously by humans at levels far in excess of that delivered in the
smoke of a cigarette. Environmental regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to
the use, disposal and transportation of signiﬁcant quantities of ammonia have no bearing on
the appropriateness of its use in cigarette manufacture. The Occupational Safety and Health

Administration (OSHA) workplace exposure limit for ammonia greatly exceeds any levels

TO: Gina Fawcett DATE: April 17, 1995

SUBJECT: Marlem Ultra Lights Test Market

As we discussed, the following forwards for your review the background information concerning
the Marlboro Ultra Lights test market along with specific trade issues.

Bagkgrogmd

Marlboro Ultra Lights Kings and 100's were introduced into three test markets during 1989.
These markets were Indianapolis, IN, and Portland, OR, on April 17, 1989, and Nashville, TN,
on September 18, 1989. During 1994, the test market was expanded to include Kentucky. The

Marlboro Ultra Lights test market is now in its sixth year.

Our objective has been to restore and maintain Marlboro Ultra Lights to the four test markets and
restrict further distribution outside the designated area.

Tra I ue

Marlboro Ultra Lights has been found in a number of retail stores outside the test market areas.
This has been an issue for almost as long as the brand has been available. Approximately 70 of
our direct customers are selling Marlboro Ultra Lights to about 4,000 retail accounts located
outside the designated test market areas. The product has been found in 21 states. These are

preliminary numbers based on data received from the STARS group.

Selected wholesalers use Marlboro Ultra Lights as leverage to win over retail accounts (located
outside the test market) from their competitors. This creates an unfair sales advantage for those

wholesalersnot designated as Marlboro Ultra Lights distributors.

Retailers have used similar tactics to gain distribution of Marlboro Ultra Lights, A retailer will
demand their distributor to supply the product or else they will take their business elsewhere. For
example, Clark Oil (:1 chain of 800 stores throughout the Midwest) threatened to take their business
to a wholesaler that could supply them with Marlboro Ultra Lights. In addition, a Sam's Club in

Indianapolis allegedly solicited retail accounts in Northwest Indiana.

distribution of the test market. Philip Morris notiﬁed direct customers by letter in April 1991 and
May 1992 that we would discontinue selling test market product to any customer selling outside the

designated area.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

$U|JE<3Tl Scientific Article

 
Attached hereto is an important and interesting recently publishediarticle
by Dr. Carl C. Seltzer at Harvard. It contains a critical analysis of the
Framingham Heart Study, which. has been the principal epidemiological study
relied upon by the Surgeon General to reach his conclusion that there is a
strong association between smoking and coronary heart disease (CHD).

Inithis article, Dr. Seltzer disputes the SurgeoniGeneral's conclusion and
points are:
l. The statistical association between smoking and heart disease is below
strong association. In fact, under the Hutchison-Wynder criterion,
the association would be designated as "weak."

2. The Framingham data do not demonstrate any increase in the incidence
of CHD‘based upon the duration of smoking in either men or women.

3. Most significant is the finding that smokers who quit smoking have a
lower incidence of CHD than people who have never smoked at all.

Dr. Seltzer concludes that the important Framingham study simply does not
support the "conventional wisdom" which the Surgeon General has propagated.

RE: Retention of Records for Antitrust Lawsuit (Lorillard v.

Philip Morris)

 

Lorillard recently sued Philip Morris, Incorporated
("Philip Morris") in federal court in Greensboro, charging that Philip
Morris is attempting to unlawfully monopolize the retail cigarette

Lorillard' s lawsuit has been consolidated with similar suits brought

by R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson. Our lawsuit charges that
Philip Morris‘ Retail Leaders program violates federal and state
antitrust laws because it requires retailers to commit to exclusionary
levels of display of Philip Morris brands, preventing Lorillard and
other competitors from effectively displaying and advertising their
brands. The judge in the case has issued a preliminary injunction
that prevents Philip Morris from enforcing the more restrictive
provisions of the Retail Leaders program. We expect that our suit
will proceed to trial next spring.
As part of the pretrial proceedings, Philip Morris has
served Lorillard with a request for documents, and we require your
immediate assistance in helping the Company respond to this request.
Please review this memo carefully, determine if you have any documents

Colorado or to ANSR in Minnesota.
MINNESOTA:

Currently, there is not a GASP organization in the state of
Minnesota. However, there is an active chapter of ANSR which has
its only statewide office in Minneapolis.

Line III Evaporators - Soaking for Cleaning

In reference to your question about soaking the evaporators as an
alternative means of cleaning, I contacted Sirrine to see if the
structural steel was designed to support this type of load.

structural steel will support the flooded weight of all four evaporators.

Since Mr. Reeves left open the question on the support lugs for the
Department at Chemetron told me by phone on November 1, 1988, that all
evaporators they build are designed to be flooded and the support lugs are
designed to handle this type of load. He said that soaking is a common
practice with many of their evaporator customers. .He cautioned us not to
run the main drive on the rotor as this would do damage to the unit. He
mentioned that some users do have a "clean out drive" that turns the rotor
not put any extra pressure on the unit while soaking (i.e. keep vent.
valves open so pressure cannot build up).

My recommendation based on the above is to only soak 1 evaporator at
a time and ensure that the main rotor drive is locked out prior to filling
the evaporator. Pulling the cover plate off the top of the mist
eliminator and removing the eliminator screen will provide both a vent
Opening and an inspection port to allow your operator to see when the
evaporator is full of water. With this cover off, you could fill the
evaporator with process hot water and crack open the jacket steam just a

I understand you have a procedure being written for this operation
which I will be reviewing with you prior to using the soaking method for
cleaning.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Additional handsheets of 10% TiO2 paper were received from the Paper Technology

about the acceptability of TiO2 in overwraps. Both paper types had better opacrty‘ than the

innerwnap-type paper now being used.

Severall samples of coatedlmat perforated to different: porosities at K-C were
received; K-C’s hole pattern is more widely spaced than the pattern used in the present
cartridges. Controllcamridges without perforated mat, cartridges with the lab perforated
mat, and cartridges from the four levels of K-C perforated mat are being prepared for
machine smoking TPM delivery.

perforation vs no mat perforation, laminated vs unlaminated calendered overwrap, and
calend‘ered vs uncalenderedllaminated overwrap (P9TS innerwrap). TPMl was greater with
perforated mat. There was only a marginal difference between laminated and unlaminated
calenderedlpapers. For this particular paper, calendering also improved delivery slightly.
Calendering would have less of an effect: with lower porosity overwraps. These data support

This is where Mr. Califano, in his misguided zealousness,

protecting. Such demagoguery serves only to cloud the issue,

other members of the tobacco industry, has provided more than

questions. In many of these years this commitment has exceeded
that of any government department, and‘has been substantially

SUBJECT: International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and
Climate, Toronto, Canada, July 29—Aug 3, 1991

A speaker at the opening session said that in seeking to con-
serve energy in recent years, "we have created a monster." The
monster has several faces: medical problems, building problems
(which have expanded beyond the "sick building syndrome" of com-
mercial buildings to include residential homes and even apart—
ments), and social, economic and political problems.

Other aspects are involved as well. Research into indoor air
quality (IAQ) has grown at a tremendous rate since the first in-
cently, scientific attention had been focused chiefly on outdoor
air quality;~now, however, there is a new science -- indoor air
chemistry -- with more funds and more investigators, especially
in the industrialized nations. There also is a surprising amount
laboration with western researchers.

There is more concern about IAQ because most people spend
about 80-90% of their time indoors during their lives, and tight—
ened structures generate and retain more harmful or potentially
list contains hundreds of items, some of them produced naturally
by the human organism.

The overall situation is compounded by the fact that the com-
plex actions of-many indoor substances as well as the interac-
tions between them are presently little understood. The immense
amount of variability of human reactions to agents indoor adds to
the complexity of trying to determine what factor (5) may create
a risk and who is at risk upon exposure.

Scientists are not always helpful with data that often seem to
be a bit far out. For example, taking a shower subjects everyone
ic compounds (VOC) in the water. Many of these chemicals have
been shown to be harmful to health.

It seems valid to say that people in the developed countries
generally are not adversely affected by all the putatively harm—
ful substances they encounter every day while they are indoors.

It is equally valid to say that nobody really can say what are CD

the long—term effects of many of the things floating in the in- ag

PARTICIPATION IN LEAP MEETINGS

This requests your assistance in scheduling our participation
in the Region LEAP meetings. I believe that you’ ve heard
about these sessions, perhaps referred to as PECOS training.
Sales has invited us, as well as Marketing Services and Trade
Marketing, to participate with them in these meetings. This
will give us an opportunity to develop better working
relationships with these people that are so critical to our
business.

The objective is to have the Brand Group and their respective
Marketing Services counterparts participate in the regional
meeting where their businesses are strongest. The schedule
of meetings are listed below:

Event For Dates Locations Hotel

West 3/30 — 4/1 Phoenix, AZ Hyatt Regency at
Region 5 Civic Plaza
Midwest 4/6—8 Phoenix, AZ Omni Adams Hotel
Region 4

Northwest 6/1-3 Nashville, TN Opryland Hotel
Region 1

Southwest 6/29 - 7/1 Nashville, TN Opryland Hotel
Region 2

It would make most sense to me if Virginia Slims would be at
the Southeast meeting, Parliament and Merit to be at the
Northeast meeting and Benson & Hedges to be either at the
West or Midwest (the West maybe on too-short timing). Please
confirm with Denise whether you are available for the
appropriate dates. Additionally, Arthur and Susan need to
let me know which dates they are available.

Accordingly, we are recommending the discontinuance of the G & R service

TNTEQRATED NIELSEN PANEL

Beginning with January 1994 data (to be issued the first week of March), a new
"Integrated" Nielsen service will be featured in place of the Nielsen Expanded audit
panel. This represents the next phase in our development plan to provide a
comprehensive weekly & monthly tracking service with representation of major trade

classes.

The new Integrated panel will combine audit data from the existing 800 convenience
stores in the Expanded panel with Nielsen scanner data from supermarkets (2,000

stores), drug stores (250) and mass merchandisers (250).

Enhancements
- The new service will provide a unified data source for both weekly and monthly

tracking, with each individual trade class and all outlet combined data available on a
weekly and monthly basis.

- Flash reports will be available in about +15 business days from the close of the
period (beginning with February 1994 data) and on-line access will following in
approximately 2-3 days. The delivery schedule will improve to +10 business days by

- Standard causal data (including instant redeemable coupon incidence and values,
features and displays) will uniformly be available for each trade class. Additionally,
beginning the fourth quarter 1994, causal collection in the scanning trade classes will
expand to include buy downs, incentives and free product deals to be consistent with
current weekly collection practices in the 400 store weekly C—store audit service.

- Pricing data will be available for all trade classes, with supermarket, drug and mass
posted price (exclusive of coupons).

- Total sample size will increase by 22% to 3,300 stores, with the expansion
concentrated in supermarkets, providing stronger representation and statistical
confidence in the data, particularly at the Section level.

' New store groups will be available including Nielsen county size (A, B,C and D) for
all trade classes and Retail Masters/N on Masters and Chain/Independents for

supermarkets and convenience stores.

Sections.

- Key account data will be available for a total of 88 scanning supermarket retailers,
six drug stores and six mass merchandisers (including K—mart and Wal Mart).

mar: FDA Regulation of Tobacco Products

Today President Clinton announced that the US. Food and Drug
Administration has issued regulations governing tobacco products, with the
stated purpose of reducing underage tobacco use. As you know, we firmly
believe that kids shouldn't smoke, and we're leading the industry in
preventing underage access to cigarettes.

On May 15, we proposed federal legislation that would make it
impossible for anyone to legally obtain tobacco products in the U.S. without a
face-to-face transaction where age can be veriﬁed. We believe a legislative
approach, which President Clinton has said he would prefer, would take us a
cigarettes. We hope Congress will take up this issue soon.

The FDA's plan is wrong-headed. It's illegal. And we're going to ﬁght
it with everything we've got. The agency claims it must seize control over
cigarette advertising, promotion and sales to prevent underage smoking. And
FDA Commissioner Kessler says that once his agency takes control of the
tobacco industry, it could ban cigarettes.

This Pandora's box of regulation ﬂies in the face of the law, the facts,
history, common sense and public opinion. In our comer we have the U. S.
Constitution, recent decisions by the Supreme Court, Congressional history
of Americans take our side on the central issues, including the right of adults

I

our products to adults.

Our blueprint for legislation contains many of the same elements the
FDA has proposed. But under our plan, the FDA will be expressly forbidden

produced. Papers made of Avicel with 0% CMC had processing problems. The matrix was
run with models containing Avicel with 4% and 8% CMC. Cigarettes made from these papers
are in support of the cigarette design model.

MOD trials were conducted on 4/5/94 to 4/7/94 (outside end of ﬁrst quarter but included by
default ). The slurries consisted of 15 Eucalyptus and 2 Aspen wood pulps. A third Aspen
paper was not produced due to slurry reﬁnement problems. Cigarettes made from these papers
are in support of the cigarette design model.

KC has indicated that they are considering 3% CMC, 6% PVOH, 3% Na Alginate, and 3%
Na Alginate plus Acid as their industry samples for banded papers using the gravure process.
KC shipped bobbins on 13 April. The papers and cigarettes will begin evaluation/fabrication
starting May.

Worked diligently to get KC on board with project management. Both parties have agreed to
a monthly format. KC’s manpower allocations continue to be a major concern. The goals and
objectives of this project will be greatly jeopardized if these resources are not in place by
April 22 ,1994.

Measurements and Methods Development

Trials on the rewinder table indicate that band inspection results are largely independent of
rewinding speeds ( 67 to 295 m/rnin ). However, banded paper in which the slurry contained
20% calcium carbonate showed increased difﬁculty in band detection. DCS Corp. is working
to optimize the signal to noise ratio. PM will also continue to evaluate additional banded
paper conﬁgurations for detection anomalies.

The Fidus built PPM 400 ( used to measure permeability of cigarette papers from .5 to 50 +/-
.1 Coresta) is working well . This instrument is currently used to verify paper permeability
during and after mill trials. Conversations with R&D and QA users with regards to
modiﬁcations for commercialization are forthcoming.

Two unforeseen circumstances played a role: The day before the Wall Street Journal

The product "Smoke-Free Twenty-two Menthol" submitted by Judy Smith, was ~
analyzed for the determination of nicotine, glycerin, PG and menthol. A non-mentholated
version of Smoke-Free Twenty-Two was analyzed previously for the same components.‘
The product is packaged as five "pellets" of a tobacco-like material. One pellet is inserted into
the tip end of a plastic ﬁlter holder resembling a hollow cigarette rod and is puffed upon. i

The product was assembled and "puff " for forty consecutive 35 ml puffs to determine
menthol vapors released through puffing on a 5-port smoking machine were trapped and
analyzed following a previously established procedure.’ The components released by dry
puffing were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results generated from the menthol version
are compared to results from the non-menthol version reported previously are shown below:


Nicotine ND
Glycerin ND
PG ND
Menthol <0.2 mg


The pellets were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Analysis for glycerin, PG, ;
menthol, and TA showed no within and between carton differences. Comparisons of these
components to Twenty-Two (Regular) showed greatest difference in menthol levels.

the WEL stream is used in the blend preparation, an additional
amount of the RBw stream can be used as process dilution in stock
preparation. RBw is the filtrate from the Machine Room, the excess
of which is discharged to Waste Treatment. ‘

The WEL recycle stream will have to be upgraded to use it as a
separation fluid; tobacco fibers must be removed and the stream
heated. Heating the NEL will ensure control of microbiological
activity. Implementation of this proposal will accomplish both
requirements and hence allow 387,696 pounds of tobacco to be saved
annually (Attachment 1). This project has an ROI of 19.2% and a
payback period of 4.9 years by avoiding scrap tobacco purchases.

This project was included in the 1990 Third Revised Capital

Forecast for $250,000 and was not included in the 1990-1994 Five
Year Plan.

The criwinal analysis turned out quite unfavorably for Old Gold.
But it led to a discovery which explains the results. and by thick,

health" of all {our brands.

This observation is almost absurdly simple, yet it has never been
noted as far as Professor MacTavish can learn, in any of the
scientific literature on the cigarette. It is the fact that the
amount of moisture present in the tobacco — br to put it another
way - the "freshness" of the cigarette — controls the quantity of
irritating substances formed during combustion. The dryer thﬂ
cigarette, the more irritating. And a difference in the amount
or moisture, which would be imperceptible to the smoker, can
violently effect the results of an analysis.

MaCTavish deduced this fact from a study of the results of his
first test. But to prove it he made a simple test of the smoke
from the four cigarettes under controlled moisture conditions
and by adding only 2% to Old Gold's moisture was able to make
it show up much better than any cigarette in the original test.

The reason for this powerful influence of moisture on the amount
or irritants formed is apparently that the butt and of the ciga-
rette (when the tobacco is relatively moist or "fresh") acts as

‘a condenser and withholds some or the natural irritants from
passing into the throat.
But before discussing the possibilities of using this observation
to Old Gold‘s advantage, it would be best to review the original
analysis of the four cigarettes. The four brands were bought at
‘ the same time at the United Cigar store in the Grand Central Stn‘
' tion, and the dealer told Professor MscTevish that they had all

- Milprint Pulp Contract

The December meeting of the Board of Directors of Philip Morris Incorporated
subject to clearing up two questions Legal raised. The Corporate Legal Depart-
ment has raised no further questions about the contract, and after speaking to
each member of the Executive Committee, I have authorized Milprint to enter
final negotiations with The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company for the purchase
of 12,000 tons of pulp annually for ten years beginning in 1976.

Currently, Nicolet is paying $265.00 per ton. For purposes of calculation, it
could be assumed that the pulp purchased under the proposed contract will cost
approximately $300.00 per ton.

The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company, which is controlled by the Canadian
Pacific Railroad, has been a supplier to Nicolet for seven years. The relation-
ship has been mutually satisfactory and Great Lakes' reputation is excellent.

The Milprint contract is a “take and pay“ contract as are the others, and the

capacity of 300,000 tons annually, 250,000 of which have already been committed
to Milprint, Johnson and Johnson, Bergstrom Paper Company, National Cash Register,
Proctor and Gamble, St. Regis Paper, Nekoosa Edwards, Fox River Paper and Landon

Paper.

The contract price will be the prevailing market price at the time of purchase
and although there is no contract guarantee that the price paid will be the
lowest price available, pulp prices have traditionally been uniform within the
industry. If the mill is not in operation by l976, we can withdraw from the
contract.

This annual 12,000 tons of pulp could be used in emergencies for flip top box
and soft pack production for the Philip Morris tobacco operations.

Milprint will sign the contract since Nicolet is not a legal corporation. No
guarantee will be required from Philip Morris.

At $300 per ton, this contract could total $36 million.

RE: KENT 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464—84) — TEST SUMMARY

Two LT products have recently been put through the Starch
National Smokers Panel, they are:

— Marlboro Lts. 100's
— Kent 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464-84)

The Kent 2000 product is different from the 12 mg., PM taste
alike or the 12 mg. sweet product evaluated through consumer
product testing. The Kent 2000 product (#1464—84) is closely
associated with the 12 mg. PM taste alike, however.

As a possible diagnostic aid the Kent M2 product was explored,
once again.

To review all three products were paneled among samples of 246
equal representation of the following dimensions:

- Age

— Sex

— Region

- Regular Brand by Packing
CONCLUSIONS

0 The Kent 2000 IOOMM product (#1464-84) demonstrated notable
deficiencies relative to Marlboro Lts. 100's on most
measures including:

— Average satisfaction ratings
— Satisfaction relative to current brand

— Product directionals
I These lapses in Kent 2000's performance spanned most
relevant user groups: Lo-Fi/LT, BS's/lOO's and
manufacturers. The one exception was Kent 2000's greater

by Marlboro Lt. 100's.

-S/M Assay - DBC Burley(BU) Control y§_DBC‘BU Treated

 

Four smokings of three samples were submitted by you for testing in the
S/M assay (h). The objective of this study was to determine if the enzymatic
treatment of tobacco by Genecor to remove insoluble proteins would lbwer the

S/M activity. For this experiment, DBC BUl(control) was treated with Pronase®

and washed, also BU was sham treated; i.e., washed only. IT 6565 from the
tour smokings of these handmade cigarettes were tested in strain TA98+S9 (Z).

 
The preparationlof the CSCs 010 mg/ml) was carried out by Charge No. 6908
personnel (3). The CSCs were storedlat -80°C until tested. All of the CSCs
were tested randomly at doses of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20‘mg/plate accordﬁng
to the standard test procedures 04).

All of the control data (see addendum) were within normal ranges except
for 2AA whnch was slightly lower than normal. Eachltest sample demonstratedla
dose-response and produced a response that was 2X background.

Table 1 illustrates the specific activity (S.A.) of the four smokings and
also the analysis of variance (performed using:"Minitab"). At the p>0.05
’level of signnﬁicance, the S.A.s of both the treated and sham treated samples
were lower than the BBC BU control. While this result impttes that the S/M
activity can be lowered by just sham treatment or washing the tobacco, Table 1
also shows a significant difference in the S.A.s of the treated and sham
treated; i.e., the S.A. of the Pronase® treated sample is lower. Since these
data indicated that enzymatic treatment of tobacco can signiﬁicantly lower S/M
activity, further studies in this area may be warranted. It would be useful
to also have complete filler analysis for these test sampbes, especially ﬁor
total N and cations; however, this data was not available ﬁor this experiment.
It is recommended that such analyses be included inlany future studies.
 

The GSCs yields (mg/Cigt)l and calculated total activities (T.A.) are
reported in Table 2. Analysis of variance was ahso‘perﬁormed for the T.A.
data. The difference in T.A. between the treatediand sham treated samples was
due to the higher S.A. of the sham treated (table 1) and not the CSC yield,
since the yield of both sets of samptes are nearly equah (table 2).

FROM: A.W. Spears
DATE: July 23, 1998
RE: Signiﬁcant Legal Developments

I am writing to inform you of two signiﬁcant developments which I believe could impact
favorably upon the company’s position in ongoing litigation concerning tobacco and health.

On July 16, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed a
class certiﬁcation order entered by a trial judge, and ordered that plaintiffs’ claims be dismissed
in their entirety. The trial judge had certiﬁed a class consisting of New York residents who
purchased and smoked cigarettes since 1980. The Appeals Court ruling emphatically rejected
proceedings and that the class would be unmanageable. The Court pointed out that because the
tobacco companies have a Constitutional right to cross-examine each class member, the trial

“would take hundreds of years.”

This ruling is signiﬁcant in that it represents the ﬁrst time that a state appellate court has
rejected class certiﬁcation on these grounds and followed the logic of similar favorable rulings
by federal court judges throughout the country. We are hopeful that other state judges will be
guided by this inﬂuential court and adopt its clear and reasoned approach to class actions
pending in various state courts.
In another meaningful decision, a federal judge here in Greensboro, Judge William
Osteen, ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency’s classiﬁcation of environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) as a “Group A carcinogen” was wrong as a matter of law and fact. Judge
Osteen found that the EPA did not follow the well—founded rules of procedure it was required to
and improperly adjusted established scientiﬁc procedures to validate the agency’s predetermined
conclusions. The Judge made it clear that had EPA followed such rules, it might have reached a

different conclusion.

This opinion is important in that it validates our long-held view that ETS has not been
scientiﬁcally proven to cause cancer or other diseases in non-smokers. We also believe that this
decision will make it more difﬁcult for states and localities to justify draconian smoking
restrictions in public places like restaurants and bars.

We are encouraged that these courts have applied the law in a fair and even-handed
manner in the face of unprecedented assaults on our business. I will continue to keep you
apprised of other such developments. ,

Mr. J. D. schardt Date: June 14, 1985

PM dAsE‘a41 DIylSION III
Craig in U.S. Patent 2,583,548 teaches the treatment of cellulosic pulp
chloride solution which gives a salt to fiber dry weight ratio from 1.67
to 10; causing the pulp containing the calcium chloride to a prolonged
mechanical,treatment, and then adding a soluble salt such as sodium
carbdnate to react with the calcium chloride to form a precipitated
calcium campound pigment.

Our‘case (Serial No. 519,619) differs from that of Craig in that the

cellulosic pulp is caused to swell and hydrate by chemical means by react-

ing the cellulosic pulp with the ammonium and/or alkali metal hydroxides
which in addition force the polyvalent metal ions to be fixed in the

of the cellulosic matrix. Both of these mechanisms of precipitating or
fixing metalic ions uniformly in the cellulosic matrix are probably
responsible for altering the combustion of the cellulosic substrate and

for improving the subjective character of smoke. The required amounts

of precipitated or fixed metal ions needed to achieve this effect is
(in our case the ratio of salt to cellulosic material is less than 0.4).

Briskin, et. al., (U.S. Patent 3,640,285) deals with the treatment of
cigarette paper containing calcium or magnesium or strontium or barium
oxalate, pivalate, tannate. This paper could be produced by treating an
existing cigarette paper containing calcium carbonate with oxalic acid or
pivalic or tannic, or by adding the desired salt to the cellulosic pulp
used in the original formation of the paper web (see column 2 lines 65-69).

In this case, Briskin teaches the selection of one salt over another for

a cigarette paper and his method of treatment in no way teaches or makes
obvious the treatment of cellulosic material with hydroxides of ammonium
and/or alkalies to uniformly fix a polyvalent metal cation to the cellulo—
sic matrix. In column 2 lines 37-38 "The oxalic acid solution operates to
convert calcium carbonate to insoluble calcium oxalate." We do not see any

relation in this statement to those of ours since Briskin converts one
insoluble salt, CaCO3, to another insoluble salt, calcium oxalate, and

difference whether the oxalate is added to the paper at the pulping section
in place of calcium carbonate or is formed by treating the paper containing

the carbonate with oxalic acid. As a result our invention is in no way

similar or obvious from the Briskin teachings. Also, it is claimed in Claim

1 that one of the anions that could be used to form the calcium salt is
“lactic acid" which forms calcium lactate with a very good solubility iﬂ_
water! '

Product Requirements: Vantage, Mark VII and New Leaf Identified Tests
As you know, we are planning to undertake personal placement tests in 4 cities
of identified Vantage, New Leaf and Mark VII. In order to implement these tests,
we require 32,000 cigarettes(160 cartons) each of New Leaf and Mark VII. "(The
Vantage cigarettes will be purchased from jobbers in each city.) All brand and
other identifying markings on both the cartons and individual packages are not

to be removed, since these are identified tests. Finally, we must insure that both
the Mark VII and New Leaf cigarettes are of comparable age.

 

It must be understood that the Mark VII being referred to here is the product that
is currently being sold in the Tucson test market, and not the new or improved versions
currently being developed by R&D.

The 160 cartons of both Mark VII and New Leaf should be divided into the following
quantities and shipped to these addresses for tax stamping purposes:

Denise,

You asked for topics that WRA might present at the upcoming Worldwide
Corporate Affairs Conference in November. These biannual conferences bring
together all Corporate Affairs staff at virtually all levels and from all operating
companies worldwide. The Conference tries to expose Corporate Affairs staff
from the different businesses to each other and to create a sense of common

purpose.

Traditionally, presentations range from the tactical (a proposed PM-USA
workplace accommodation plan) to the strategic (emerging issues tracking),
attempt to capture activities across all the business units both domestically and
internationally andvalso include some stretch themes, such as how technology
will affect the future. A highlight of the 1997 conference was a techno-futurist


While it would be helpful to know the "theme" for the 1999 conference, my point
is that while almost any topic could find a home at past conferences, the more a

presentation could fill more than one bill the better, Lg, worldwide rather than
just USA, cutting across businesses rather than tobacco alone, and so forth. My
guess would be that the theme of this year's conference will center around the
new four strategic directions - alignment, constructive engagement, image and
proactive dialogue - in an attempt to cohere all PM Corporate Affairs staff with a

shared vision.

Given past conferences and my assumption for this year‘s theme, I recommend
two potential WRA presentations: New Regulatory Engagement and Courtesy
of Choice. Both would "fit" as examples of initiatives the Company is taking that
are consistent with the new strategic direction.

1. "New Regulatory Engagement” (working title) would implicitly explain l
WRA's role in the context of explaining emerging regulatory issues and new
approaches to working with the regulatory community. This topic is an
outgrowth of your recent ZRF presentation. However, the issue scope should

_ 2. In one initial trial, Dr. Farone and his staﬁf have shown that
reduction of the nitrate in the BL effluent by a microbiological process is
feasible. Unden the current schedule. they would expect to have a pilot plant

SUBJECT: Kent Golden Light Menthol
Based on‘the information I have obtained; the extra-
polated sales oﬁ KGL on an annualized, national basis will
be approximately five (5) billion units, It would appear
that an unusually good opportunity to increase the sales
impact of this brand will be missed if we do not introduce
a KGL Menthol-

The supportive data for this opinion is shown in‘Tables
l and 2, These tables list the available sales data for
brands that have been introdhcedlsince 1966 with‘a companion
products as reported by Maxwell, except where noted.

As can be seen, the average percent of sales of the
menthol products relative to the nonrmenthol for the com—
petitive brands is 54%, and for the Eorillard brands 57.6%.
Assuming this data would translate if a KGL Menthol was
introduced, the anticipated‘sales of the menthol brand
would be approximately two to three billion units during

In evaluating the data shown in the Tables” it should
be remembered that one of the most acceptedwmethods of fore—
casting sales trends is;a technique called "exponential
smoothing". This simply means that the most recent data is
data for brands introduced before l966 would be superfluous
for this type of forecasting. It can also be seen that if
only the brands which have been{introduced recently are
considered, then the percent of menthol sales relative to
the non—menthol would be greater than 60%.

MEMORANDUM
Mr. Randy Spell
M. L. Orlowsky

March 8, 2000 .


A few suggestions regarding various pieces of information to be considered for inclusion in
MPID reports:

llz

Minor Manufacturers/Brand Report

Too much emphasis is placedlon share of market analysis (see report dated 3/6): and not
enough on proviciing volume Clara. ?ercentage gains/losses ofshare is really not very
relevant as opposed to this comparison based on volume. The report should include
adrlitional information related to volumes, i.e., annual shipments for 1998 and 3999, year-
percentage changes. This does not have to be developed to the division ieveL but could
be helpful either on a regional or area basis. The report tends to dwell on what occurred
in the past. This is good up to a point, however, some hypothesizing as to future; would
be better. Since this report is based on Excel data, we should also consider similar
additions to the MSA shipment analyses.

Pricing Comparisons

Some time ago, we discussed developing average pricing comp atisons to establish a
history as well as a current picture of the percentage differentials between the various
price segments ofthe market. What is the status of this information?
Given the growing importance of minor brands, we should include, wherever possible, a
complete View of the market by including the minors along with the majors. I am not
certain of the availability of the minor sales data. A review should be moxie to determine
what is available and how this information can be Excluded as part of the on-going
analyses.

You may remember that ianay 1977 ASH petitioned
the Food and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes
as drugs under the Federal Ebod, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
by the ULS. District Court for the District of Columbia in

1979.

ASH appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of
memorandnm to‘the‘COmmittee of Counsel from Covington &
Burﬂing describes the oral arguments before the Court of

Appeals on May 13.

Two related actions by ASH are pending, One seeks
to have the FDA regulate cigarettes as medical devices
because they dispense nicotine andithe other asks the FDA‘
to find that cigarette filters are medical devices. The

attached articte from the May 19 issue of the Legal Times of

MINIMUM SALES AGE FOR CIGARETTES IN PENNSYLVANIA

This memorandum responds to the February 18, 1993
letter from Richard A. Lewis, District Attorney for Dauphin
County, Pennsylvania, to Ernest D: Preate, Jr., Attorney General
of Pennsylvania, in which Mr. Lewis requests that the Attorney
General issue a formal opinion addressing the minimum sales age
for cigarettes in Pennsylvania. Mr. Lewis suggests that

Pennsylvania law prohibits the sale of cigarettes to persons

under the age of 21. He notes that Section 6306 of the Crimes
Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6306, prohibits the sale of cigarettes to
"any minor," and that the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. C.S.

§ 1991, defines a "minor? as "an individual under the age of 21

years."

In fact, the minimum sales age for cigarettes has been
18 since 1990, when Section 6305 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S.
§ 6305, was amended to raise the minimum sales age for "tobacco,
in any form," from 16 to 18. The minimum sales age for
cigarettes, as for other tobacco products, previously was 16, as

specified in Section 6305 prior to the 1990 amendment.

The District Attorney's reliance on the Statutory

Construction Act is misplaced. That Act itself provides that the

definitions contained in Section 1991 apply only when the context

does not "clearly indicate[ ] otherwise." 1 Pa. C.S. § 1991: see

Subjectt Paper Development Weekly‘Summary

VIRGINIA SLIMS LOW SIDESTREAM

Cigarettes were made in the semiworks to Virginia Slims Lights speciﬁcations using
K-C’s V3 and V51 grade papers were each sized to give respective weight additions of 10.0%
and 12.0% KH2 13’0é , The binary magnesite paper was sized to give a 5.6% weight addition of
K succinate. All of these cigarettes, and an additional model made with grade ODS paper from
Kimberly-Clark’s one-step process, gave at least a 50% reduction in sidestrearn:visibility.
PROJECT MAGIC

Mainstream smoldng analyses were completed on a set of four cigarettes made in the
semiworks with‘a 45 glm“ binary magnesite base paper (PlTY) that had been treated by Ecusta
with four separate sizing solutions: potassium citrate/sucrose, potassium citratejsucrose/citric
acidl potassium citrate/sucrose/sulfuric acid, and potassium citratelsulfuric acid. These
cigarettes did not exhibit any significant differences in tar delivery. Sidestream visibility
reductions ranged from 50% to 60%. Subjective screening to date has not shown any of these
additives to‘be superior to potassium suecinate, which was used on previous cigarette model‘s.

CELLULOSE DERIVATIZATIVON

A contract on the joint development of cellulosic materials for use in‘ or on cigarette
paper has been signed by PM andisentl to Aqualon Co. for approvall

CIGARETTE PAPER SPECIFICATIONS

A sampling of twenty bobbins of 10-058A cigarette wrapper was begun to determine
Kimberly-Clark’s process capabilities for calcium carbonate concentration and porosity. The
twenty bobbins were selected from speciﬁc points in a mill roll; samples are being taken at 600
meter intervals throughout the bobbins for the analyses

BLEND COMPOSITION ANAILYSIS

Blend composition analyses have been completed on once—a—month samples of the
following cigarettes monitored over a six-month period: (I) Marlboro 85 SP (MC), (2)
Marlboro Menthol 85 SP (Louisville), (3)1 Merit 85 SP (Cabarrus) and (4) PM Lights 85 SP

SUBJECT: Salem Pianissimo - Japan

At your request, the following information has been compiled in reference to the ﬁlter systems used for
the Salem Pianissimo 100’s (2 mg) and Salem Pianissimo Lights 100’s (6 mg) products produced by RJ
Reynolds for the Japanese market. Although the product claims low side stream, there is nothing too

As the attached PTL data indicate, the ﬁlters for both products are conventional mono—acetate plugs. Both
. products use one row of Hauni on—line ventilation (20 .holes per row) to achieve the ventilation levels for
the products. The measured ventilation levels used to achieve the tar values, are comparable to the levels

used by numerous products to meet those tar deliveries. It would appear that the high level of ventilation
and the level of expanded tobacco are the mechanisms used to acquire a 10W tar delivery for the 2 mg
product.

obtaining a PMO aerosol which would enable human inhalation

of about 30 mg of PMO over a period of a few minutes to a
few hours.

# 40 hand-bulb nebulizer operated either by squeezing or by
low pressure laboratory air after removing the bulb. The

amount of liquid dispensed, found by weight loss after a
given number of squeezes, was as follows:

lzl propylene glycol—water (w/w) 2.0
PMO saturated 4:1 propylene glycol—water (w/w) 0.93
PMO saturated propylene glycol 0.4
The variability in delivery is undoubtedly due either
to evaporation, in the case of water, or weight gain of water
by hydroscopic propylene glycol. The true delivery is
probably about 1 mg/squeeze as was obtained for the 4:1

propylene glycol-water mixture which should be nearly in
equilibrium with air at 35% humidity.

The room temperature solubility (@ 24°C) of PMO was found

to be 123 mg/g in propylene glycol and 65 mg/g in 4:1 propylene

glycol-water (w/w). (For practical purposes PMO is insoluble
in water or glycerine.)

squeezes would be required to deliver 30 mg of PMO from PMO

saturated propylene glycol and 460 squeezes for PMO saturated
4:1 propylene glycol-water.

The nebulizer filled with PMO saturated 4:1 propylene

To: H. J. Minnemeyer
FROM: J. H. Bell

SUBJECT: Cigarette Modification Project Report

On Friday May 12 the writer met with Ms. S. Ireland and Dr. J.
Reid to discuss a concern for a more concentrated effort in the
targeted in the cigarette modification project. Ms. Ireland and
Dr. Reid were most receptive to the suggestion that a re-direc—
>tion of some activities was in order.

A catechol/phenol analysis has been developed and demonstrated by
the writer. However, the method involves the same instrumenta—
tion that is used for the BAP analysis. The sharing of this
equipment proved to be very clumsy and resulted in a less effi-
cient laboratory operation. Ms. Ireland has agreed to accept
this analysis into her section and has assigned Dr. Aruna Prakash
as the investigator. A Perkin-Elmer LS-4O Fluorescence Spectro-
meter will be needed and is being purchased at this time.

Dr. Reid was agreeable to the suggestion that Dr. Paul
SchickedantZ's contribution to this project could best be made in
procedures can be established in his laboratory in one week. The
collection system may be an initial problem. However, smoke
samples can be provided to him until a more proficient protocol

is devised.

The NNN analysis which has always been run in‘the Tobacco Science
Section will remain in that section, but will be done under the
scrutiny of Dr. F. Perini. The results of the analysis have been
rather erratic over the last few months. Variations in ng/cig or
ppm have been as high as 100% while some recoveries have been as
low as 1.5%. Dr. Perini will investigate these problems and make
the necessary procedural changes. In addition, he has been asked
to include NNK with the analysis. This will entail a more
sophisticated clean-up procedure which dOes not include decolo-

rizing charcoal.

Subject: Current Theoretical Considerations on the Origin of MS NNK from
Water-Washed Fillers and Basewebs

Hot water washing (as in the RL process) results in base webs (BWsw
with greatly reduced MS NNN and NAT levels relative to‘corresponding levels
from feedstock, but MS NNK levels are not reduced‘by this process.” The same
phenomenon occurs when out filler is exhaustively washed with water at room
temperature.2 The MS NNK delivered by water-washed fillers and BWs‘ has been
referred to as pyrosynthetic NNK. I“ '

The pyrosynthetic formation of TSNA in MS smoke has been studied for'
several years by Project 6908.’ Although not included in official documentab
tion previously, the most common hypothesis used to explain the ﬁailure of
water extraction to remove the source of MS NNK was as follows: there is a
water-insoluble amine precursor remaining: in‘ the extracted filler which‘
reacts with a nitrosating agent, also derived from a water-insoluble source,
to form NNK. The water—insoluble amine precursor undergoes pyrolytic clea-
vage, either before or after nitrosation, and then the NNK transfers to Ms.
of the above theories include any explanation of how or when these MS NNK
precursors are formed. As a‘result of recent discussions in Project 6908; a
new hypothesis has been advancedi which encompasses most of the previous
theories as well as some new ideas; The current hypothesis is stated below:

some of the nicotine present in tobacco becomes bound before curing iscomplete. Part of
the bound nicotine is oxidized to bloundpseudooiynicotine (PsON) or a related NNK precursor,
NNK, while a: portion may remain in nitrosatablefonn; Water extraction does not removed]!
bound NNK or the remaining bound ‘ NNK precursors“ NNK is‘released from the boundfonn
and is also pyrosynthesized‘from bound NNK precursors (or from! bound nicotine): during
smoking, and the total NNK released partially transfers as MS ‘NNK or is decomposed during
the smoking process.

In the remainder of this memo, the derivation oi the above hypothesis
is described} andlplans that have been made to substantiate these concepts
are briefly presented.

Attached is a copy of the Lorillard Market Overviews for 12-months ending March 2000 which are based
on MSA shipment data for the ﬁve major companies only (PM, RJR, B&W, LLD, and L1G).

Breakouts included in this report are as follows:

Markets - each Lorillard Area, Region and Division as well as Total US.
'Items - Industry, key segments, and companies by brand


- Share of Market
- Share point change vs. year ago
- Share Development Indjces (SDI's) versus U.S. levels

Following is a brief summary of full price versus discount trends by key brands and Areas.

FULL PRICE/BRANDS

Full Price share continues to grow in most Areas with increases ranging from +26 point in the Midwest
Area (73.79 SOM) to +1.81 points or +2% in the Western Area (75.20 SOM).

In total, the top six Full Price brands -- Marlboro, Newport, Camel, Winston, K001, and Salem -- account
for 82% of the category's sales. Of the six, Marlboro (37.69 SOM) is, by far, the most important and is

X Takeshi Hiraxama of Tokyo, though asked to speak on the sub-
ject of reducing cancer risk by a diet containing daily doses of
green-yellow vegetables, spent the first part of his slide pre-
sentation on the hazards of cigarette smoking. His talk was
garbled and his "slide show" was too rapid, but he was clear
enough on two items: (1) some nonsmoking males get lung cancer
when their wives are heavy smokers, and (2) smoking is at least
as important as diet in the development of stomach cancer. (This
posium.)

There was no comment at all from the audience on his cigarette
data, but a lively debate took place over his vegetable results.

RE: TRUE FOCUS GROUPS - FINAL REPORT — MRD #5542/884

________________ l__-_1f__________________________________________

BACKGROUNQ AND PURPOSE

A new True léWrtar line extension is scheduled for Test Market



proposed advertising concepts.

The primary purpose of the qualitative sessions was to obtain

input on the strengths and weaknesses of each concept and


to understand consumers' reactions to a new True product in light _

 

MEIEQD

, A total of eighE focus group sessions were conducted in two
markets -— Manhassett, Long Island and Atlanta, Georgia. All
groups were composed of competitive smokers (10+ cigarettes per
day) between the ages 25 and 44. The structure of the groups was
consistent across both markets —— half male, half female; half
lo—tar, half lo—fi (low tar prone). "Low tar prone“ was defined

as having "top 3 box" purchase intent to try a low tar brand in
the future.

CONCLUSIOHS

Overall, the True Gold concept met with favorable reaction. The
and low tar segments although females were certainly more
positive about it than males. (While more males were positive
than negative, favorability among this group occurred at a lower
frequency when compared to females). Males tended to see the
concept as more feminine whereas females were more likely to View

it as neutral:'.; '

g; 'Because of the many differences in creative presentation,~

Urea Replacement Program—~Preliminary Outline

While working with Dr. Swain on the RL improvement project, we
tried various valeric acids, both alone and in combinations, at
several levels. We also tried them as their ammonium salts to increase
their solubilities to give more uniformity as well as to give a
source of ammonia. Because of the low level of those salts that can

be used to give the optimum taste effect, very little ammonia is added
to the filler.

While in Argentina, 1 injected some of their Marlboro cigarettes
with ammonium hydroxide on the last day there. Those who smoked the
injected cigarettes agreed that the cigarettes were smoother, more
salivating, and tasted more like our U.S. Marlboros. As this was
tried my last day in Argentina, we could not explore it any further,
but it seemed to confirm my thinking that some of the better taste of
RCB compared with RL may be due to the presence of ammonia or compounds
formed that will generate ammonia on pyrolysis.

On my return we tried ammonium acetate, ammonium carbonate,
ammonium carbamate, and ammonium lactate in #544 blend Marlboro cigar~
ettes containing no urea in the RL. The ammonium carbonate and
ammonium acetate were harsher and drier tasting while the ammonium
carbamate and ammonium lactate were smoother and more salivating.

Dr. Swain requested pilot plant samples of RL made with the
carbamateand lactate salts. We should also evaluate samples made with
these salts incorporated in the aftercutting solution to compare the
retention of the ammonia on the filler when added at the end of the
proceSsing versus that when incorporated in the RL.

If the samples made by incorporating the salts in the sheet or the
we should screen the ammonium salts of other organic acids such as
gluconic, tartaric, pectic, malic, citric, etc., which have FDA GRAS
status. Even ammonium salts of some amino acids should be screened,

although glycine may be the best one from cost and availability consider—
ations.

We should review all past work done on RCB to determine what
reaction products containing ammonia and/or nitrogenous compbund
is not available, we should initiate a study to give us that information.
We should also compare the nitrogen—containing pyrolysis products of
RCB with those of RL with and without urea, ammonia, and various ammonium
salts. Such studies should give us clues as to whether it is ammonia
and/or reaction products generated during pyrolysis which give the better
taste to RCB over RL.

Subject: . Differences between smokers of Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights

As Peggy Martin noted in her memo on this subject, the major difference

between smokers of Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights is their age. Most of
of the different age distributions. As she also mentioned, the National POL
Panel, on which those data are based, is short of young smokers and blacks,
because of the difficulty in recruiting them and keeping them on the panel, and
is heavily weighted with women. (when we select panelists for a product test
we select based on the true distribution of smokers of the brand of interest,
as you know.) Because the Panel is not truly representative of the market, I
looked at the data from the Tracking Study.

Percent who smoke Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights by age

The top panel of Figure 1 shows the percent of all smokers who smoke a Marlboro
Light or Winston Light (King or 100), by age. Winston Lights Kings has its
highest market penetration among smokers 35 to 44 years old and Winston Lights
the case of Winston, the 100mm version skews toward somewhat older ages then
the King, but unlike Winston Lights 1005, Marlboro Lights 100 still has its
highest market penetration among the youngest smokersl

different packings of Marlboro Lights, by age. In both cases the box packings
skew more toward young smokers than the soft packs. This is true of virtually
every brand that is available in both box and soft pack.

Historical patterns of smoking of Marlboro Red and Marlboro Lights
Marlboro Lights has not always skewed so heavily to the young smokers. Until
the early 19805 the growth of Marlboro Lights was largely a result of people
switching out of Marlboro Red, and its smokers were not as young as smokers of
Marlboro Red. Since then it has become increasingly an entry brand. Figure 2
shows the percent of smokers, by age, who smoked Marlboro Red and Marlboro
Lights (Kings or 1005) for the years 1979 to 1987.

Note that after several years during which both Marlboro Red and Marlboro
from 1986 to 1987. This, I think, is less cause for worry than might appear at
first glance. Between 1979 and 1982 the Marlboro Lights share of 18—21 year—
old smokers increased by eight percentage points, from

Subject: Mass Spectral Analysis of Residue from ART Pilot Plant

GC-MS analysis was performed on a sample of residue obtained from the
reactor at the ART pilot plant. This sample was originally submitted by
Jose Nepomuceno, request code Z89095, sample code Z9DS. The sample was
taken up in hexane and analyzed by GC—MS using the JEOL SX 102 mass
spectrometer. A 15 meter, DB-S, 0.25 pm column was used with conditions of
initial temperature 100°C, heating rate of 10°/min., and final temperature
of 325°C with a ten minute hold time. The mass spectrometer was operated in
the electron impact mode (EI) with 70 eV ionization potential, 10 Kev
acceleration and a scan speed of 1 scan/sec over the mass range 0—800.

Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatogram for the sample. Important
components include: hexane solvent (scan 67), neophytadiene (scan 516),
(lS,2E,4R,7E,11E)-2,7,ll-cembratriene-4,6—diol (scan 746) and a number of
components in the region of scan 950—1300 are long-chained hydrocarbon
waxes, there are two notable exceptions. The first is the component
substructure with aromatic character and an aliphatic chain. The second is
the component observed at scan 1205 which appears to have a cholestane type
structure. Absolute identification of these compounds has not been

Comparison of this material to ART materials analyzed previously
reveals no components unique to this residue (see memo: Mass
Spectral Analyses of ART Samples to D. Leyden, from N. Jensen 9/22/89). If
one compares this material to solid material obtained as residue from higher
pressure ART runs, the major difference is in relative distribution of
various components. For this residue sample, the abundances of
neophytadiene, the cembratrienediol and the cholestane type compound are
increased with respect to the abundances of the hydrocarbons as compared to
ART solid material analyzed previously. There are also some differences in
relative distribution within the hydrocarbon region.

The total ion chromatogram for the sample is attached and mass spectra
have been obtained for all components indicated in the TIC. If you need
additional information or have questions please contact me.

RE: TRUE "QUIT" CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

I have prepared the following analysis based on the Gallup and Robinson data
for True "Quit” ads tested to date, a total of 15 observations. The ads
tested ran during May, l975 and February, 1976, and included the original .
Tip-in test of the campaign. Although this analysis covers male smokers
only, female data is also available if you find this type of report to

be useful.

This memo will:

l) Track effectiveness over time, and 2) attempt to isolate the
vreasons for success or failure.

Listed below is a re—cap of each G & R observation of a True "Quit" ad.
True) run in the test issues, and average smoker scores for all Super Hi—Fi
brands (excluding True) run in the test issues.
Initial True scores were above the average for all cigarettes but fell
below average in the third observation. The next 8 observations scored
below average, while recent ads have scored much higher. However, the True
"Quit“ ads have consistently outperformed the average competitive Super Hi-Fi
ads throughout the campaign.

changes to note are:
1. Placement in back—up stock (see TACTICS #1 in page 2).

2. Revised quantities of S/F/A small catalogs for the Boston
and Milwaukee divisions (see NEXT STEPS in page 4).

The following outlines the details of the Newport Franchise
Continuity Test Program.

BACKGROUND

In evaluating marketing initiatives to maintain the Newport
consumer base, a Franchise Continuity Test Program has been
developed. The test program will be implemented in the Boston
and Milwaukee markets, with a starting date of April 29,1996.

The strategies set forth for this program are as follows:

1. Develop a program to reward continuity of purchase among
Newport's current users.

2. Offer premium items that reflect Newport’s quality product
image.

3. Create a look and feel consistent with Newport's brand
imagery.

4. Deliver a small catalog on packs and on cartons to target

5. Feature an 800# in the small catalog through which consumers
may request a larger catalog (containing a greater selection
of items) via mail.

REPORT ON SMOKING AND HEALTH
You have received earlier reports of Institute activity to

meet the 1983 report. This is a supplement to them.

A letter from me, with supporting enclosures (see attached
sample) was delivered prior to publication of the report to
each member of Congress.

The staff recontacted reporters and news bureau chiefs, who
had undergone staff briefings earlier,‘to provide them in
person with copies of the "executive summary" of our
position on smoking and heart disease (copy attached).

Following the Brandt-Koop news conference last Thursday at
11, 22 news organizations sought TI response and were given
our brief statement (copy attached). (There were 31 other
media inquiries the same day about the "Great American
Smokeout" and our staff response to that is also attached).

Major media coverage was thorough but not flamboyant or
"front-page." The New York Times used a UPI story, in
3. The wall Street Journal had a modest, inside story.
USA Today gave the report three paragraphs at the end of a
short story on the "Smokeout." 0n evening TV news
broadcasts Thursday, ABC covered the story in 100 seconds,
CBS 135 seconds, and NBC 110. All had TI's comments, and


Last Friday, we prepared and distributed (for Sunday

Single-Blade Carbon Heater Evaluation:

from Laser Mechanical. A manual switch has been installed for heater switching. This ﬁrst
prototype ﬁxture was manufactured from MACOR. A second PEEK ﬁxture is expected tomorrow.
If prototype evaluations are successful, ﬁve more PEEK ﬁxtureswill befabricated.

Tobacco Substrate Studies:

Bright and burley dust samples are being separated by mesh size (100 to <270‘ mesh).
These samples will be used to prepare cast sheets to detemiine the effect of particle size
on sheet integrity and subjective character.

IR camera studies of glassy carbon heaters, coated with cast tobacco sheet using
temperatures up to 409 ° C. Continued modiﬁcations are being made to the binder system to
submitted to Dr. Carchman for pyrolysis GC/MS analysis (300, 600 and 900 ° C).

MT Orientall strip has been cut and adhered to carbonr heater strips for baseline
subjective evaluation. Two different high ﬂavor, highr alkaloid blend dusts (ca. 200 mesh)
have been received from Flavor Development. These samples will be sieved to separate into
discreet me sh sizes for cast sheet preparation and subjective screening.
Miscellaneous:

moisture determination on heaters, cast sheets and tobacco dust samples.

Assistance was provided to the Materials group to coat screen-printed ceramic heater
prototypes with tobacco sheet for thermal evaluation. A calcium crosslinked Konjac ﬂour
adhesive system resisted sheet/heater delamination at temperatures >400 ° C‘ as measured by
thermocouple (estimated >450 ° C actual). Further studies will be conducted to determine the
surface properties of the screen-printed heaters.

to begin consideration of ﬂavor system development for the RTX prototype. Based on their
initial subjective evaluation of prototypes containing Burley and Flue-Cured sheets, Belll
and Garrett are selecting ﬂavor ingredients for subjective screenings beginning next week.

SUBJECT: Laboratory Test Results on Some Sample Cigarettes Used
Safety Act

A series of 32 cigarettes were prepared for the Technical Study
Group as directed in the 1984 Cigarette Safety Act. Specifi-
cations of these cigarettes are given in the November 4, 1985
evaluated for smoke deliveries and linear burn rates. These
results are given in Table 1 and 2 for the 21 mm and 25 mm
circumference cigarettes.
This series covers a linear burn rate range of 3.40 mm/min to
10.63 mm/min. The linear burn rates between the corresponding
21 mm and 25 mm samples were similar except for the expanded
flue-cured cigarettes (21 mm, 13—16) and (25 mm, 29—32). These
differences are illustrated in Figure 1.

In this study, paper porosity influences smoke deliveries more
than paper additives. A decrease in porosity from 75 to 10
CORESTA resulted in a 20 to 40 percent increase in nicotine, CPM
and CO deliveries. The addition of citrate caused a modest
increase in C0 and a 5.to 15 percent reduction in CPM and nicotine.

Burn rate studies were conducted between FNLN—Zl, the slowest
burning cigarette, and BNLC—Zl whose linear burn rate of 5.79
mm/min is more consistent with commercial cigarettes. This study
shows very little difference between FNLN—21 and BNLC—Zl on a
select group of fabrics. The results shown in Table III include

a previous study involving a set of four cigarettes on 33 different
fabrics.

sumecr‘ mam TQ FT, LEONARD woon FOR vxcaaoy PRICE TEST - .1

PURPOSE OF VISIT

Ft. Leonard Wood is a late addition to the VICEROY military price
test, with VPR offerings beginning July 18. Previously, Ft. Knox

refused to expand the style offerings with a $1. 50 VPR, so Leonard‘
Wood is being used as a replacement. f

 

_While it was intended that a $1.50 VPR be used at this commissary,'

» assess the appropriateness of continuing the test, Ft. Leonard


were made while visiting the Ft. Leonard Wood Commissary.

 

OBSERVATIONS

1. Sales - Approximately five cases of VKSF, two cases of ”m
VSL and one case of VRL 100's were sold on July 29 (a pay
day). This was accomplished with a 6—carton maximum per

person. Prior to the test, average VICEROY volume was 90
cartons per week, all of it in VKSF. The sales volume on
this Friday represented a 26- fold increase over average
re-promotion volume. Sales would have een substantlally
higher had not the supply of RICH LIGHTS 100's been depleted

_ by noon.lh

VICEROY was the lar est sellin brand at the commissary on
Generic sales volume averaged 5—6 cases per day before the
test; since the promotion, generic sales have averaged 2-3

cases per day.

 

Source of Business - Based on informal observation, a majority
of purchasers appeared to be former generic smokers (many of

whom were former VICEROY smokers). Other major competitive -,.
sources of business were Winston, Marlboro or Pall Mall smokers.

3. Reasons For Not Purchasin - Those consumers who did not pur- ,
chase VICEROYs sa1d that they generally smoked low tar or .
menthol cigarettes, were loyal to their own brand (particularly
Marlboro, RALEIGH and Kent smokers), or were VICEROY trier- “‘ ”

rejectors.

SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF KABAT SAMPLING/ANALYSIS TEST AT LPF

Objectives;

1.

Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat concentration (PPM) within
a hogshead of strip.

Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat application and process
systems at the Leaf Processing Facility (LPF).

Determine the average difference between Kabat (methoprene) results

generated at Universal Leaf Tobacco Company (ULT) using the CC method and
results generated at PM using‘the HPEC method.
Conclusions:

1.

The average amount of variation in the Kabat concentration for the
fifteen (15) hogsheads which were sampled‘during the test was 1.1 PPM.
The "projected" average variation in the fourteen (14) hogsheads which
were not sampled was 1.3 PPM. Based on a 95% confidence interval of the
overall average variation, the Kabat concentration within an individual
hogshead can vary by i 2.4 PPM around the average value.

The Kabat flow for each system was set at a rate which was calculated to
achieve a projected‘Kabat value of 7.5 PPM at a constant rate of tobacco

a 95% confidence interval. The data for each of the systems is as
follows:

 

S stem er# E_ _g_ Projected Kzlifference §§_ 953 C,I,
1 49 5.7‘ 7.5 - 1.8 1.3 i 2.6
2 49 6.0 7.5 - 1.5 1.3 i 2.7
3 49 6.2 7.5 - 1.3 2.2 i 4.3

All parameters were held as steady as possible during the tests which
were conducted, therefore the estimates of variation for each system are
probably the best that can be achieved at this time. Under normal
operating conditions, the variation would probably be greater.

Subject: Collecting cigarette butts from ashtrays

L. T. Kozlowski is the individual who has published information on examining spent cigarette ﬁlters
for evidence of ventilation hole blocking. Attached are abstracts of ﬁve papers he has published on this

subject; please note that the search strategy was not a priori restricted to Kozlowski. The abstracts do
not make explicit statements regarding the source of the butts used in the studies, so it is impossible to

pinpoint one that may have entailed collecting cigarette butts from ashtrays, without reading the actual

papers. If none of the papers is the one you are seeking, the next step probably should be to look at
the cited papers and the subsequent papers citing Kozlowski’s publications.

The attached abstracts are from the psycINFO {DIALOG: File 11}, EMBASE {Excerpta Medica; DIALOG:

SUBJECT: Survey for Airborne Friable Materials in the Greensboro
' Accounting Department ‘ , -.. . ;;€

 

The discovery of suspect whitish particles on the desk of

5. 7 Mr. Wayne Oakes led to an airborne survey of the office followed

(H? by qualitative microscopic analysis of the filter membrane. A
’- personal sampling pump was calibrated with an in-line Millipore

AA 0.8 micron filter at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. An
eight-hour sample was taken on October 28, 1986 as per NIOSH “--
asbestos method &CAM239. The absolute sensitivity of the method
was 0.1 fiber/cm of ir. The present permissible exposure limit
(PEL) is 0.2 fiber/cm of air. Upon completion of the survey,

the filter cassette was sealed, labelled and transferred to the
Analytical Development section for qualitative microscopic

- analysis. '

A portion of the membrane filter was mounted and analyzed by an
151 Super III Scanning Electron Microscope for the physical
appearance of the trapped particulates (1). No asbestiform
fibrous materials were found. Cellulosic paper particles, as
noted in Figures 1 and 2, and paper filler particles noted in
Figures 3 and 4 were the predominant species. These inert j
materials, which are found in office environments, are considered .g-
nuisance dusts and constitute no health hazard. i

HTI Test Of Two Virginia Slims Packages; Box Vs. Current Soft Pack
(Project No. 8718/8719)

r

The purpose of this test was to determine the degree of consumer interest
in a box version of Virginia Slims relative to the current soft pack. To

tion Virginia Slims Soft Pack were mailed to 325 women (125 were Virginia
Slims smokers, and 200 were smokers of ”other” 100mm non-menthol filters).
About two weeks after receiving their cigarettes, each woman was contacted
via telephone and interviewed with regard to her: 1) overall preference,

2) package preference, and 3) whether or not she noted any differences
between the cigarettes themselves.
It should be kept in mind that the Virginia Slims cigarettes used in both
packages were identical with regard to all qualitative characteristics

except overall cigarette length (the cigarettes in the experimental box
were about 2mm shorter).

 

SUMMARY/DISCUSSION


in the soft pack and those in the box (49/51 for Virginia Slims
smokers and 54/46 for smokers of ”other” 100mm non-menthols).

The reasons for overall preference were based mainly on perceived
differences between the cigarettes rather than package differences.

The majority of women who gave a packaging reason for their over—
all choicei voted in favor of the box.

When questioned directly as to their preferences between the

i
l
g
3
packages2 the women indicated that the box was preferred over
cross-section smokers). It was also found that each type of
package possessed its own, unique attributes:
Box: ”Cigarettes didn’t crush/Box protected them?” ”No 10956
tobaCCO/Neat/Not Messy,” "Cigarettes didn't fall out,”
"Keeps cigarettes fresh/moist/not dry.”

into cigarette case” ”Smaller/Not Bulky.”

Finally, when asked about the differences between the cigarettes
themselves. the women in both smoker groups tended to believe

that those cigarettes in the soft pack were ”milder/less harsh”
than those in the box.

Generally, we conclude that box packaging is preferred to the
soft paper pack by a majority of women 100mm smokers. However,
this preference is a ”weak” one, in that it had little impact
on overall preference. Also it appears that cigarettes packed

in the traditional soft paper package are perceived as being
”milder/less harsh” than those packaged in the hard box.

within New York City at an "attractive price above cost." I have
looked at Local Law 27 of 1990 of the City of New York to
determine the answer to the following question: whether the
general prohibition contained therein against distributing free
samples of tobacco products would extend to distributions at an
"attractive price above cost?"

Local Law 27 of 1990 provides the following:

"Distribution of tobacco products to the general public
at less than basic cost prohibited in public places and

product for commercial purposes at less than the basic
cost of such product to members of the general public
in public places or at public events."

AdminiStrative Code of the City of New York § l7—l76(b).

There are some exceptions to the prohibition which are
not of immediate concern here and which have been addressed
elsewhere. I will concentrate, therefore, on the cost issue.

The code defines "less than basic cost" as meaning
which shall be added the full value of any stamps or
taxes which may be required by law . . ."

OVERVIEW

Among the Marlboro Lights 100mm NMF smokers, no significant differences
were indicated on preference between the Marlboro Lights 100mm
cigarettes (52%), and Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm (48%).

Qualitatively, mrlboro was perceived to have a "milder taste" and to be
"less harsh". A large percentage of the Marlboro Lights smokers
preferred their own brand because it was milder.
Among the Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm NMF smokers, no significant
differences were indicated on preference between the Marlboro Lights
100mm cigarettes (50%) and Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm (50%).
Qualitatively, Benson & Hedges was perceived to be "more satisfying" and
to "have an easier draw". Marlboro was perceived to have a "milder
taste" and to be "less harsh".

The cross section of other flavor low 100mm NME‘ smokers significantly
preferred (at 90% confidence level) the Benson & Hedges Lights
cigarettes (56%) to Marlboro Lights 100mm (44%). Qualitatively, B&H was
perceived to be "more satisfying". Marlboro Lights was perceived to be
"less harsh". ,

RE: LORILLARD MARKET 0 VER VIEWS — BASED ON

EXCEL RETAIL DATA FOR 12 MONTHS ENDING JUNE, 2000
 

Attached are Lorillard Market Overviews for the 12 months ending June, '200‘0 based on EXCEL Retail Data. These
data reﬂect the location of each retail store being supplied by wholesalers participating in our EXCEL Program. In
contrast, MSA Shipment Data are based on the location of each wholesaler’s warehouse and are, therefore, less

representative of actual consumption within a market.

Total volume reported by EXCEL participants represents approximately 95% of corresponding national industry
shipments and 406,297 retail stores.

WOM- Marketing Information & Analysis/Deborah Potter 2::1g13:
sumcrx ﬁistx Slims Flash Report (12103189) ‘

American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in

Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August.

The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and

at generic prices in Shreveport.


Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California

and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989.

o Misty slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport
(Generic Priced) and increased one~tenth in Bakersfield
Similar to when last reported, the share difference
between the two markets appears to be due to the higher
levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81% _
of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion

versus 20% in Shreveport.

o Bakersfield’s incentives include BlGlF’s, $3 off carton
purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and
free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase.

The pantyhose with carton purchase and BlGlF's continue
to be reported in Shreveport's outlets. In addition,
only one store offered the free magazine with carton
promotion in the generic priced market.

0 For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has
remained relatively constant at 64%. However,

MEMORANDUM

RE: Panel Results: Harley Lights 100 MM RﬁD #1385-6/93

Attached are the Low Tar panel results for The Harley Lights
V IOOMM proto.

Results for the previously reported Harley Lights V 85 MM
and the Regular brand are also shown as a source of

reference.

Just to note, the Regular brand testing in which these Low
Tar NM panel members tested their own brand blinded, will

The Regular brand results represent the "ideal ratings" as
most respondents were extremely favorable in their

evaluations for their regular brand (in test).

Product Specs are as follows:
Harley Lts. 100 MM 9.8 mgs. tar .71 mgs. nic.
Conclusions

The Harley Lts. 100 MM proto (1385-6-93) attained an average
acceptance of 6.5 among total respondents. While the
product scored well among 100 MM and smokers 30 years of age
and over, it netted out poorly with the 85 MM smokers and

those 18 to 29 years of age.
The 85 MM proto (1592/93-93) fared better in total, 6.8, and
smokers rated all three products the lowest of all the

sub-groups.

Product Performance
Total Smokers

The key problem with Harley Lts. 100 MM is its "too
light/not strong enough" taste. It was not cited as overly
harsh tasting or having an unpleasant aftertaste.

MEMORANDUM TO THE FILE:
Tobacco Institute Executive Committee

At the 1/17/90 meeting of the TI Executive Committee
in California, the Plan outlined in the attachment was
presented, discussed and approved.

Pursuant to instructions from Mr. A. Tisch, who was
not in attendance, I questioned at length, and in detail, the
extent to which any of the proposed $6,649,000 budget, which
includes a $1,000,000 contingency, could be met from already
budgeted 1990 TI programs. After lengthy discussion, and
responses from Mr. Chilcote that the overall costs could
approved.

Mr. Johnston, as Chairman, indicated that as costs for
the program are developed and assigned, the Staff is
instructed to make a good faith effort to allocate some of the
costs to existing budget slots. The latter assurance was
given in response to my strenuous urging tht the costs be met
through the existing budget. Those demands were made by me at
Mr. Tisch’s instructions, with the understanding that if I
failed to convince the TIEC membership to our view, I was
authorized to vote for the project as a special assessment,
"out of budget" program. I did so vote.

I requested Mr. Johnston to telephone Mr. Tisch upon
his return from California to discuss the Executive
Committee’s deliberations, and informed Mr. Tisch of the
Committee’s actions during a discussion with him on 1/22/90.

SUBJECT: PROPOSED STUDIES UN THE EFFECTS OF CYCLDBEXTRINS UPDN THE COMPOSITION
OF TDBQCCD SMOKE

INTRODUCTION:

This proposal outlines a research project focused on the use of cyclodextrins as
a filtering device for benzoEaprrene in cigarette smoke.
In brief, cyclodextrins (CyD) are carbohydrates formed by the enzymatic
degradation of starch. The majority of Cyﬂ‘s used are alpha, beta and gamma
are linked in a large ring by 1,4 glucoside linkages. This results in a rigid,
interior ranges from 5.7 to 9.5 A in diameter depending upon the number of
hydrophobic while the erior of the cavity is hydrophobic. These properties
of the CyD allow the formation of stable CyU complexes with other molecules.(1)
 

Today cyclodextrins are widely used in foods, cosmetics and toiletries due to
their ability to molecularly encapsulate flavors and fragrances. It is this
ability that makes CyU’s attractive for use in cigarettes. In fact, the
Several studies on the application of cyclodextrins to stabilize cigarette
flavors have been reported: Rob et al. from Philip Morris examined the
stabili ion of menthol, furan, anethole, linalool, geraniol, cineol,
work several patents were obtained.(3,4,5) In addition to these studies
numerous other people outside of the tobacco industry have investigated CyD
complexes of materials common to both their interests and cigarettes.(b)
Lorillard studies conducted by P. Schickedantz have addressed the use CyD’s for
flavor stabilization and delivery. He erlored the complexation of citral and

  

 
A secon- area of CyU research has involved the incorporation of Cyﬂ’s

in this aspect of CyD use have focused on the abilities of _yE’ ’o :3

cigaret , cyclodextrins appear to offer a great potenti for adsorbing not ‘3
only tar and nicotine but other biologically active components found in GD

There is widespread consensus that Mayor Koch's: antibemkj‘ng‘ proposal,

together with the clear bias that will emanate fran the califano‘ Cc‘nmittee, is

of serious national concern and has multiple negative implications fOr‘ our

We anticipate a lengthy, difficult, potentially acrinoniws campaign to‘ defeat
this anti-smoking measure.

In order to accarplish this, we are assembling a special New Yerk City‘Task
Force, which will work full time on this important effort fOr at least the
next SD days. The Task Force will be situated in the large ninth floor
conference man and will serve as the nerve center of the company's effOrt to‘
defeat the Mayor's anti-smoking efforts. The Task Force will consist of

professional and clerical personnel, drawn franw throughout the corporation for

tanporany duty. The Task Force will operate in liaison with the PM U.S.A.
Corporate Affairs Department to ensure a coordinated, correct approach.

We very mach need your assistance in forming this special Task Force. Because
most of the activities of the Task Fbrce center on coordination and logistics
between myriad disciplines and activities, we believe the Task Force Leader

Jeannine Dcwlinq's name immediately comes to mind. Her successful experience
with two World Fairs: and‘ with her current duties indicate she is the best
choice.

Consequently, we would respectfully request that Ms. Bowling be temporarily
assigned to PM man. CorporateAffairs, for a period of 90‘ days, in order to
be the Task Force Leader of the New YOrk City Task Force. All salary and
expenses will be assumed by PM‘ U‘.S.A.‘ for the assignment period.
If you agree, we muld‘ like: to, have the Task Force leader in; place by April 2,

SUBJECT: Revi Incremental Production Costs/Paper to Vinyl

The attached details the revised incremental "production" costs associated with a conversion
to vinyl for the various PM bulletin pools. The additional costs for transportation and art
(less separation savings) are now included. Importantly, costs have actually declined
slightly for the Corporate pool versus those presented on Monday, while Marlboro costs


to vinyl production. The savings applies only to the Corporate pool, given that Marlboro
separation charges were included in the Marcann paper printing costs. As a result, minor
increases in transportation costs due to heavier weight for vinyl was more than offset by
signiﬁcant savings due to the elimination of separation charges for the Corporate pool.
Below is a breakdown of the revised incremental costs per unit per cycle for both pools.

Subject: Weekly Summary - Paper Prod. Development - Feb. 27 - March 10, 1995

§A11 Prod. Launch - Japan (IPP§):

Attended a meeting to plan the next steps for moving into production of Virginia
Slims Special Lights, and to prepare for Danchi testing of menthol prototypes.

Discussed incoming material testing for paper composition with QSE personnel,
who will look into potential differences in analytical methodology (CaCOS and MKP by
X—ray) between the 43g/m2 and the current Superslims production 53 g/m2 paper.

Sue Tafur and i also met with QSE personnel to discuss conventional QA
testing of shipments of low sidestream paper with experimental codes 10-994A, 10-
995A and 10-996A. it was decided that it would be sufficient to test only every fourth
pallet for Coresta, CaCOS and MKP. initially, the Coresta will be measured at Ft&D
while the possibility of getting a proper 10 cm2 external clamp for Cabarrus is pursued.

Received samples from Roger Slagle for investigation of competitor (RJR)
cigarettes in white packs. A testing plan was developed with Liz Chambers, and
samples were distributed to PTL and General Analytical.

4Agg Support to Marketing/Market Research:
Supplied bobbins of 53 g/m2, 9.5 Coresta low sidestream paper for additional
1mg prototype production in Semiworks and sent for larger quantities of paper from the

pallet we had arranged for K-C to ship to the warehouse.

Requested cigarettes for 8-port testing and prepared the samples for

In an attempt to exploit this behavior, Chris Campbell and I have
developed an idea for a filter design which should increase the preferential

Our idea is to construct concentric filters with two different

SUBJECT! Determination of Organic Aldehyde Delivery for
An Experimental smokable Article Submitted by
D. R. Smart (PROJECT B‘491, SA)

Introduction

Samples of a prototype smokable article (hereinafter called
'experimental cigarettes“) were submitted by D. R; Smart for
determination of aldehyde delivery. Kent III cigarettes with
the tipping perforations taped were analyzed as‘a control.

Eagerimental

Both experimental and control cigarettes were conditioned in

the smoking laboratory at standard FTC temperature and humidity
conditions for a minimum of 24 hours. The first 9 puffS‘of each
cigarette were collected under standard conditions using a‘35 mL
puff volume, 2 seconds in duration, at one minute intervals, then
a clearing puff was taken. The whole smoke was trapped in a 125
mL Dreschel bottle containing 50 mL of trapping reagent. The
trapping reagent contained 200 mL of 0.125% dinitrophenyl—
hydrazine (DNPH) in‘acetonitrile, 20 mL of 1 N perchloric acid.
diluted to 500 mL with acetonitrilew After smoking, the DNPH—
smoke solution was neutralized with 2 mL of 1 N triethylamine.
The DNPH complexed smoke solutions were analyzed by HPLC—UV
analysis at 360 nm. The Hewlett Packard 1090 M\HPLC was equipped
with Novapak (C18) column 3u9 x 150 mm, with a 5 mm particle
size. The mobile phase was acetonitrile, water, tetrahydrofuran
(60:30:100 with a ﬁlow rate of 1 mL/mﬂn. An injection‘volume of
with acetonitrile at 2 mL/min for 30‘minutes.

Results

Samples of three sets of cigarettes obtained from Gordon Bokelman have
been videotaped at a magnification intermediate to those which were used in
the previous videotape. The cigarettes used were:

D9DA’1‘ Dual-wrapped with 45 g/M’ outer paper having 35% CaCO,,
(#9569) 0.4% NH.H,PO., 0.3% NaCMC, and 5% Kzsuccinate, and inner

(#9571) with 35% Caco, and 10% mum.

Marlboro Lights 100's as control

For all three cigarette sample sets, the burning event took place as we
move around the circumference of the cigarette in‘ one direction or the other,
sometimes changing direction while on the visible side. Visual observation
of two cigarettes, placed in the chamber so that both sides could be seen,
showed the burn‘ proceeding on one side and then the other alternately in the
same direction. This suggested that the burn did, indeed, circle around the
full circumference in whichever direction it was moving.

The smoke from the Marlboro cigarette was visible in close proximity to
the rod, and on the images from these tapes the smoke was seen moving upward
along the front side of the rod, a few millimeters ahead of the char li‘ne
emanates ﬂrom the underside of the rod a few millimeters ahead of the char
(Figures 1 to 4), but the video image of the low sidestream cigarettes did
not always include a plume above the rod (Figure 2) . During the taping, a
plume of smoke could always be seen‘ above these cigarettes by visual
inspection. Where the video image shows no plume, the smoke had coalesced to
camera. The visible smoke from the low sidestream cigarettes was
considerably less than that produced by the Marlboro cigarettes.

The cigarettes with the single wrapper of heavy-weight paper showed
portion of the rod, with sometimes startling visual displays (Figures 3 a 4) .
Depending on the orientation of the holes with respect to the camera, there
was a series of small plumes sometimes from the underside, sometimes from the
top, and occasionally they were visible on the front surface of the rod.

Based on‘discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical

models were designed specifically for research‘on sidestream smoke

investigate the effect of cigarette circumference and Mg(OH92
wrapper. In order to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes
were made at three different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24.8
mm) each with a standard commercial wrapper (Kimberly-Clark 156)
and with a 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from
the same batch of tobacco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered

and RL 1508 was used. It contained no stems or expanded tobaccos,
so that better looking ultra slim cigarettes could be produced. All
samples had the same casing:and aftercut system.

Background

When producing the Harley Light Box 80's product, R&D was
confronted with significant manufacturing problems.

Specifically, the current box product was not found to be close
enough in taste characteristics to that of the 85’s sort pack
version. Additionally, the box product varied as R&D had trouble
maintaining the product’s specifications.

Thus, R&D developed a revised Harley Lights Box product that
employed a new filter which enabled the prototype to have taste
characteristics that were closer to the king size Harley Lights.

Please note, since the time this study was initiated, R&D has
resolved the manufacturing problem and is now producing a

consistent box 80’s product that successfully meets product
specifications.


The Action Standard set for this study was a parity or better

performance for the prototype versus the current Harley Lights
Box 80's product among Marlboro Lights Box 80’s smokers.

Summary of 6908 Activities for 1989

Oriental Tobacco Studies
A.

A study of the effect of agronomic variables on preformed TSNA and
MS smoke TSNA from oriental tobacco was concluded. Samsun and
and effects of topping, flue-curing and sun-curing were studied.
nomic variables had a very substantial influence on the transfer/
pyrosynthesis phenomena leading to the observed levels of TSNA in
MS smoke.26 Sun-curing gave much lower levels of preformed TSNA
than flue-curing. The lowest levels of MS TSNA relative to TPM
were delivered by the sun-cured and not-topped Samsun tobacco.

A pilot study was carried out on the relationship of chemical
characteristics of different oriental varieties to the levels of
endogenous TSNA found and MS TSNA produced when corresponding

cigarettes were smoked. There were significant variations in both
endogenous TSNA and MS TSNA among the three varieties.27

Based on the results of the pilot study described above, an
expanded study of eight oriental varieties was completed except
for final data analysis. Wide ranges in the levels of various
well as grade designation in some cases. Only two varieties had
levels of endogenous TSNA typical of those found in blended
oriental fillers. Very low endogenous TSNA values were observed
for the other varieties. The variety found to yield the highest
level of MS TSNA was not the one which had the highest levels of
endogenous'll'SNA.28
Samples of American Aromatic Tobacco (AAT) that were grown in 1985
under bright conditions with air-curing were obtained from Roger
Bass (Project 2525). AAT originated%from crosses between a South
American tobacco, a bright variety, and a burley. The TSNA levels
were lower than those found for a typical burley, but higher than
those found normally for oriental. NAT levels were considerably
low as is normal for burley. Endogenous TSNA tended to be propor-
tional to abienol levels in the five different crosses tested,
with some exceptions.29

A New Method of Qualitative Product Test Analysis

Eagkground

The following quote is from a memo by E. J. Gray (10/29/69) th under J. E. Lincoln,
developed the current technique:

volume of response indicates the magnitude of a qualitative difference.
In other words, the higher the percentage of given responses, the
greater we assume the quality to be

one.

assumptionu Granted, we rarely make the mistake of saying "Blend B
lost the test because it was too strong", the implication is usually
present. In other words, "Blend B lost the test". Later we say "Blend

B was considErably stronger than BlendiA". i feel that our readers
put these two together.

Since the time that this issue was raised, we have tried two ways of settling the
question. The present document is submitted as the third, and possibly definitive
answer to the question, with new insights into understanding reasons for preference

of cigarettes, with implied new directions for interpreting blind product test
reports and new directions for R&D efforts.

Summarv,>ConcLusion§_§ndlRecommendations

1. This document spells out in detail, and gives five examples of a new technique
that should be added to the analytic devices currently used in evaluating blind
product tests. It should be given more weight in interpretation (because of
greater sensitivity) than‘the current reporting of "qualitative evaluation".

which smokers are asked to report on after testing each product, rather than the
open ends. The ﬁormer provides fuller data on‘larger bases, the latter gives
some of the same kind of information but on much smaller bases.

3. Certain key conclusions can be generalized from the data on ten different

products reported here, and they apply to all the groups of smokers covered;
(including smokers of Marlboro 85'5, Marlboro 100's, other filters and hi—fi'g).

quﬂ: CONCORD'S PROMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE *
In order to create trade and consumer excitement about the
introduction of Concord, PM USA came up with two interesting promotions:


To introduce customers to this new product, key accounts were
given portable stereo cassettes which contained a tape featuring the
Concord message. (The stereo cassette was theirs to keep.) The
volume on the cassette was pre-set at the highest level possible.
Introductory music was the first sound you heard, followed by the
text. The text began by informing the listener that the announcer
knew what the listener had just done -- he adjusted the sound to the
tone that was comfortable for his easy listening. The announcer then
5 mg. to 15 mg. per cigarette, depending on his mood. The announcer
invited the listener to try a free sample of the Concord cigarettes
which were enclosed with the cassette recorder and tape. A copy of
the Concord Regular and Concord Menthol texts are attached for your
review.

For Consumers:
sweepstakes whereby consumers automatically entered into the drawing

when they redeemed their coupons. Top prize consisted of a Ford
Mustang, a Hawaiian Cruise or $15,000 cash. Coupons were inserted

in magazines, newspapers and supplements. When a consumer rubbed off

the top right portion of the game card insert, he was entitled to a

free pack or carton of Concord. When he redeemed the game card for his
prize, he wrote his name and address on the bottom of the card, as well

was then automatically entered into the "Suit Your Taste" Sweepstakes.
(Copies of the coupon and free samples are attached for your information.

Sale of "Rothmans" brands by Philip Morris under
license in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean

As you know, Philip Morris Incorporated has a license from Rembrandt
Group Limited, whereby Philip Harris may exploit certain cigarette brands


For calendar year 1935, the sales results for all these licensed brands

have been:
Volume (Units)
U.S.A. 162,179,720
0.3.3.. Duty — Free 102,7A0,400
Export to Latin America/Caribbean 67,610,000
TOTAL 332,530,120

The cigarettes have been made for Philip Morris on a contract manufacture
basis by Hothmans Canada, Rothmans International and Liggett Group. The
marginal contribution after contract manufacture, but before any
expenses, is approximately $9 per 1000 cigarettes i.e. almost $3

$96,337.11; for calendar 1985.

Limited. on these sales, Philip Harris Incorporated retains $90,907 in

Group's U.S.A. subsidiary Larus & Brother Cmpany.

New License from Swiss cmany

There has been some concern about Philip Morris Incorporated's continued
participation as the seller and distributior of these cigarette brands.

A suggestion has been made to substitute a new licenson (i.e. a Swiss
company). This option has been examined, but appears extremely
complicated and impractical. The only feasible way to arrange this
license from a Swiss Company would be via a New Agreement. A new license
agreement from a Swiss company would have the following effects.

No continuing license or distribution relationship with a South African

addressed in his hill and would be the topic for the ﬁrst panel, witness Assistant Secretary for
Occupational Safety and Health Charles N. Jeffress. FolloWing the testimony of chﬁ’ess, were two
panels that discussed FDA authority. The fourth panel discussed possible compensation models for

noting that ET S contains 4,000 chemicals and compounds, 43 known human carcinogens and that

exposure to ETS is associated with asthma. cancer, lung cancer and heart disease. He urged
Congress to do two things:

-Declare a Congressional ﬁnding that ETS causes health effects; and

-Pass legislation on ETS that does not preempt stronger laws.

Ieffress said that if Congress would pass legislation containing ETS provisions then
OSHA would not have to issue a ﬁnal rule, instead the agency would only have to deal with
enforcement issues, which could be put into place in a “matter of months.” OSHA would prefer
legislation, according to chﬁ'ess. because the rulemaldng process can take four years or longer (“[a

Chemical and SalmaﬁeZZa/Microsome Differentiation of Elmenhorst

SUMMARY

Chemical and Salmonella/microsome assay data on NSC from a
high nitrate cigarette (XBDBNX; bright + 6.7% NaN03) suggest that
there are significant differences between Elmenhorst cold trapped
Considering our data and some literature data as well, we suggest
that additional biological evaluation(s) be conducted on‘a ciga-
rette containing a high level of filler nitrate (e. g.,.added

INTRODUCTION '

Interest in nitrate addition to tobacco filler has been
stimulated by reports of decreased in viva activity of NSCs from
such cigarettes. , The addition of nitrate to filler has been 7
reported to affect both WSC composition and cigarette delivery.
Among the effects reported are reductions in puff count; TPM,
However, nitrate addition also leads to largeeincreases in

the levels of many smoke components: nitroalkanes;3—nitrobenzenes;“

and hitrosamines. The reason for these increases presumably is

with many components in smoke. . . ,

1

_ This NDX reactivity has also been demonstrated to lead to :
aging artifacts (methyl nitrite) in the gas phase from high nitrate
cigarettes.6 There is also a report that the observed decreased

catechol level in ECT NSC from high nitrate cigarettes is due to 3
artifactual formation of 4-nitrocatechol in the cold traps.7 l

Other studies of nitrophenols in smoke question the artifactual
formation of these compounds.8

AThe chemical differences described above are differences

NBL Product Development

Marlboro conﬁguration cigarettes incorporating NBL (with 15 parts ammonia) produced during
the April trial at the current BL Plant line speed (350 fpm) and at increased line speed

(390 fpm) were evaluated by the Flavor Technology panel and found to have subjective parity
with the Marlboro control. When submitted to the Richmond panel, differences were detected,
however, the opinion of the panelists were that NBL is close subjectively and could achieve

parity with fine tune adjustments to the dryer profile.

A BL plant factory trial was conducted in May to produce NBL at 390 fpm with a reduced
ammonia formulation from 15 parts to 10 parts. Air sampling was conducted on Line 1 to
confirm the reduction of ammonia in the dryer emissions. Preliminary results indicated a 40%
reduction in ammonia emissions (normalized to production throughput) was achieved which is
in line with expected reductions based upon theoretical calculations.

Cigarettes incorporating NBL (with 10 parts ammonia) produced in the May trial have been
produced and are scheduled for evaluation by the Flavor Technology panel the week of

August 2, 1993.

A cost estimate to retrofit the BL Plant with the minimum essential equipment to produce NBL
at an increase line rate of 390 fpm has been prepared. The estimated cost is $3.2 million

total capital and expense which would generate a 42.0 % ROI based upon reduced overtime at
the BL Plant to produce forecasted production of 47 million pounds. An implementation
schedule will be established after review with Environmental Engineering to assess the
implications of implementing NBL with regards to timing and environmental control
requirements for the environmental permit at the BL plant site.

With conversion of the BL Plant to NBL, the facility would have the capability to produce
Cast Leaf with the addition of a guar gum feeder.

Monthly Report, Project Delta — April 1982

Objectives:

1. Provide experimental data for nontobacco smoking article patent
application.

2. Conduct experiments on the use of heat to transfer flavor.

from tobacco to smoke.

4. 'Prepare reports on extrusion technology and the preparation of
nontobacco combustible heat sources.

Conclusions:

1. A meeting was held on the fifteenth of April with Bob Shaw to discuss
our application for a patent on nontobacco smoking articles. Bob is now
preparing the application based on information supplied at the meeting.
Experiments are being conducted which will supply additional data requested.

' 2. The electric cigarette has been used to generate a smoke aerosol
from afterécutsolution. Initial measurements show that a typical after—cut
taste is produced when the gas stream temperature is 15098. When the gas
stream temperature is raised to 200°C the taste degenerates to a burned sugar
character. Additional experiments are being conducted to measure the
temperature of the solution during heating under each of the above conditions.
3- Our G.C. has been fitted with two new columns in order to enhance
our ability to measure the concentration of flavors in TPM extracts. The

4. Information from our notes is being assembled for reports on various
aspects of experimental efforts during the course of Project Delta. One special
report on binderless extrusion has been prepared and others on foamed tobacco,
combustible heat sources, the delivery of extruded tobacco, and‘the taste of
extruded tobacco articles, are being written.

Earlier today you received Geoff Bible’s desk drop on the proposed settlement with

just the beginning of the process and until we know that the requisite number of
states agree to participate, it is premature for us to discuss any of the implications of

G. E. Inskeep
Remarks on Office Action on Helf. 582-518, PM #472

The bentonite in the present specification is not described
as ”calcined" and is not intended to be, but is the naturally
occurring finely divided or substantially colloidal form.

Kauffman specifies and claims repeatedly calcined bentonite
as the carrier for medicaments or vaporizable smoke-treating
agents, and describes the calcined bentonite as having ”few, if
any, of the distinguishing characteristics by which bentonites
are commonly identified and that it is a substantially different
col. 2, l. 44). The calcined product is said to be no longer
colloidal. The agglomeration which is responsible for this means

that the product would not have the characteristics itemized on
p. 7, l. 12, of the present specification, since there would be

considerable pores and fissures and the particles could absorb
nicotine (at least in the sense of taking the liquid into the
pores). The molded form of Kauffman would be even less applicable.

The calcined bentonite is said to be a selective adsorbent
for nicotine. This would make it unsuitable for choice as a
could hardly be characterized as a ”weak adsorbent," by the
definition of our specification. As was remarked in regard to
the first Office Action, our requirement for weak adsorbents for
nicotine rules out those, as in Irby, et al., and Kauffman,
use'of weak adsorbents, those references do not, even when
taken with Bavley, et al., make obvious the present invention.

It is admittedly unfortunate that one or two of our weak
adsorbents (silica gel, zeolite) have the same name as adsorbents

SUBJECT: Taste Evaluation of Menthol Samples

‘Preliminary taste evaluations have been made on
menthol samples received from UHE Co. and Manheimer.
A copy of the report is attached.

Although neither sample was rated quite equivalent
teristics, they are both probably within the range of
acceptability. The UHE Brazilian was preferred over
the Manheimer Penguin Brand. The latter sample was
designated as being Formosan but the ratio of neo-
menthol to neoisomenthol indicates that the menthol
is from plants grown in Brazil.

Marlboro Promotion Programs Qualitative Report

Attached is the moderator‘s report on the recently conducted series of focus groups on
Marlboro promotion ideas developed by Young & Rubicam. Key findings include:

- "Marlboro Country" offers opportunities to broaden and contemporize the brand's
image through connections to both environmentalism and adventure.

- The concept of ”The Marlboro Foundation" which would purchase open land for

preservation offered particularly strong imagery and made consumers feel good about
choosing Marlboro. However, there was also considerable cynicism as to the company's
motives which made any retail tie—in suspect.

a The "Marlboro Adventure Team“ concept (as executed by Y&R) offered greater
potential for promotional programs but was more limited in its imagery. While some
men relished the idea of an all out adventure in Marlboro Country, most were somewhat

intimidated. They would prefer weekend hiking or fishing trips rather than more

- Some of the later groups combined the ideas and were excited by the concept of a
Marlboro Environmental SWAT Team that would perform “heroic“ clean-ups and

respond to natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew. There appeared to be strong

appeal to the idea of modern-day Marlboro Men publicly performing strenuous ”good
deeds.“

2 month delay at Borriston Laboratories- We

do not know if it is possible to make up for
lost time as these studies continue on a monthly
basis.

B&H Heavy Spending

This is the final report evaluating the B&H Heavy—up test which began in
August 1984 in Shreveport, Seattle, Lubbock and Fresno. October
will be the last month of data reported due to the Merit Box

introduction in November which took most of the available media that
month.

Spending Levels

to Lights in Lubbock and Fresno, and DUL in Seattle and Shreveport. As
such, spending on those packings has essentially tripled, while spending
on the remaining packings has changed very little. Below is a summary
of the spending in each market.

1983 local expenditures $ 137 $ 112 $ 579 $ 134
Previous 1984 projected 145 111 624 128
Current 1984 projected 275 215 1,213 243
Current indexed to previous 190 194 194 190

Market Share

After three months of data, this test cannot be adequately evaluated.
However, at this point in time, the extra spending has had no effect on
B&H. Share changes in the test markets as well as the total U.S. are
insignificant (confidence interval is 95%).

performance in Terre Haute, Indiana.

K R U D

early September of this year. The brand was moderately sampled
and supported by newspaper and F81 inserts during its first few

months.

DESIGN

A 12-week AAU was conducted in mid-November among non-menthol,
Lo-Fi/Low Tar smokers which were further defined by the following

specifications:

. Males, 18—49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of college

Eii' . J E ]_E
. Males 50 yrs. and older

. Males 18-49 better educated

. Females 18-49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of
college

MBQ_EQEE

Please note that prior to the AAU, Lorillard's Telemarketing
Program was conducting its screening for its two carton free-
offer in Terre Haute. Although no product (Harley) had been
dropped, the incentive post card for the free cartons was mailed
to those who had been screened. There is the likelihood that
some of the respondents in the AAU received the Harley carton
offer prior to the AAU interviewing. Thus. awareness levels may
have been affected by this mail-in offer; no estimate can be

made.

indicates a sharp recovery in February. Lorillard, with 8.0%, and

Liggett & Myers with 4.6%, each posted a decline of 0.5% compared to
Williamson, after being on a six month gradual decline, rose sharply in

January to 18.6%, a new high. American had the second highest gain in
share in January rising to 16.0% (Chart #14).

Among the leading brands, Marlboro, with 14.1% was 0.7% below Winston's

share of 14.8%. Salem moved into fourth place over Pall Mall. B. & H. 100's
continued to hold eighth place among the leading brands, recording 3.7%.
Tareyton showed continued improvement from its November low of 3.3% by
attaining a 3.6% share in January (Chart #3). The lOOMM category remained
relatively steady at 23.6%. Philip Morris lOOMM's continued to lead the
category, registering 7.1% of total industry (Charts #1 and #5).

Among the other categories, the Menthol Filters posted 26.9%, continuing
. its upward growth trend. The Non-Filter category decreased 0.3% over
December to 14.5%, with Camel and Chesterfield having the largest loss in
share (Charts #1 and #9). The Charcoal category moved moderately up to

SUBJECT: A Review on the Study of Reducing MutageniCLty of Tats
Generated from Various Materials " '


Since July 25, we have performed more than 100 experiments. A
summary of the results is attached in Appendix A. We found that
there are two ways to reduce the mutagenic1ty of tar generated
either from pyrolysis or smoking: By lowering the pyrolysis/—
~smokinq temperature or by diluting highly mutagenic tar with low
mutagenic tar.

-,-,m-,-.-—-, A

The progress of our study can be divided into two stages. The

first stage is a series of preliminary tests which were carried

out in the experiments from run #1 to run #16. We used #1580
tobacco (l) as the testing sample and pyrolyzed it at various
temperatures and flow rates. The Ames test was used to detect

ha the mutagenic activity of tar. This set of data, as discussed in F
the previous report (2), shOWS that the mutagenicity of tar
increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature (Figure 1).
It also shows that the flow rate has a certain degree of effect
on the mutagenicity of tar due to the fact that the compound(s)

responsible for the activity is(are) low volatile (Figure 2).

 

The next stage is a series of screening tests of some basic
materials and the mixtures of these materials with other additives.
The results of those basic materials are listed in Table 1. The
relative values used in this table are based on the value of

91580 tobacco, which is assigned as 100. The reason to use a
relative value is that, from time to time, the reproducibility of
the experiments is not quite good probably due to the biological
uncertainty as shown in Appendix A, column 9. #1580 is thus used
as an internal reference.

From Table 1, we found that the tar from Whatman #42 filter paper
(W42), i.e., pure alpha—cellulose, has virtually no mutagenic
activity while the tar from Burley stems (BYST) has very high
activity, about 70% higher than that of the #1580 tobacco. If
BYST is thoroughly washed, the mutagenicity drops to 14% of

the unwashed one. Burley tobacco has the next highest activity,
about 40% higher than that of (1580 tobacco. The mutagenicity of
tar from flue—cured tobacco is about 30% less than that of #1580.
The reconstituted leaf from Kimberly—Clark (KCRL) has approxi—

mately the same activity as 91580. If the black water is not

Subject: 'Ilraficant Hearing on General Services Administration Policy on Smoking
in Federal! Buildings

oversight hearing before the Public Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee
(Public Works Full Committee), chaired by Rep. Jim Traﬁcant (D-OH)1. After
learning of the hearing late yesterday afternoon, I have canvassed the
“friendly” Member staffs of the Subcommittee and the Tobacco Institute as to
the current situation. My findings, initial actions, and1 future considerations

are: set forth below.

Background

Apparently, Chairman Traﬁcant indicated his intention to conduct a
hearing on the GSA’s regulations regarding smoking in federall buildings at
an organizational meeting of the Subcommittee several weeks ago. This item
was one of ﬁfteen items discussed and no particular emphasis or priority
was given to the tobacco issue at that time.

Republican sources believe that Traficant has chosen to hold? this hearing
now because the federal building smoking policy has become a “high profile”
issue due to: theactions of Rep. Durbin (D—IL). Holding the hearing now
would also be in accord with the House Democratic leadership request that
House Committee and Subcommittee Chairmen “get busy” to show action.
Moreover, these sources see some reason to believe that there may be a
Traﬁcant/Durbin “conspiracy” atwork. Apparently, Traficant‘has been:
“spending a lot of time” in the Appropriations Committee on specific District
projects, which could indicate some type of a trade off between Traflcant and
Durbin (who chairs the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee);

The Hearing N
c.
three items slated to be addressed: a
' The GSA smoking policy in federal buildings. 3
‘ The GSA plans for child care facilitiesin all federal buildings. 0')
° The GSA use of alternative fuelsin all federally leased or owned CD

SUBJECT: Monthly Summary Report for Life Sciences Section:

The following text is a summary of the activity of the Life
Sciences section during the month of April, 1987. For the most 7
'part, this report is organized by study.

1. AMES ASSAY (Hazleton Laboratories America)

3006, 3212.

The following report was received and accepted as final:
3208.

2. AMES ASSAY (Lorillard Research Center)

The following reports were accepted as finals: A078, A091,
A093, A143, B059, 3061, 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211.

Several Cigarette Smoke Condensates, including 0019, D023,
D029, D033, D034 and Reference samples were tested for
comparative mutagenicity in the Ames assay. Very little _>
no obvious differences were noted between samples. Since
these samples were frozen prior to testing, it is thought
that more reliable results might be obtained with fresher
samples. This may be pursued in a future study.

3. UDS ASSAY (Microbiological Associates)
The following compounds were sent out for testing in April:

8004, 3010, 3129, 3144.

4. UDS ASSA! (Hazleton Laboratories America)

Ithought this list could get you started in developing a smokers' rights group in the Cabarrus/Mecklenburg
area. These ten individuals are who we consider "ninjas" (internally) —— people who write and phone their
legislators frequently and want to get involved in the movement. They all belong to the PM Smokers‘
Caucus.

The woman circled, Faye Vernon, has indicated on the most recent Smokers Caucus survey that she would be
interested in starting a smokers' rights group

I think she‘s your best bet or your ﬁrst phouecall.

Subject: Recovery of Tobacco Neutrals from Water Column Effluent
The removal of hydrophobic organic compounds from aqueous effluents is
a well-known technology. For example, Bitteur and Rosset (J. Food Science

:3, 141 (1988) describe the use of octadecyl-bonded silica (0-18) and
styrene-divinylbenzene to recover blackcurrant aroma compounds from food
plant waste water. These packings selectively retain organic compounds
while inorganic salts and ionic organic compounds pass through unretained,
We reasoned that the acidic water column effluent could be pumped through C-
18 packing and the organic "flavor" components could be retained while the
protonated bases, e.g., nicotine, would pass through.

We have carried out an experiment to test this hypothesis (Notebook
8889-69). Specifically, to lOOOg of ART MPG solution was added at room
temperature 20g of Baker reversed phase packing (octadecylsilane bonded to
silica gel, 40 micron particle diameter). This suspension was stirred
vigorously for one hour and then filtered through a coarse fritted glass

of water. Nicotine analyses for the filtrate and washings were as follows:

Filtrate 27.719

lst Wash ' ' I {675

2nd Wash .038
Total 28.432g

The nicotine content of the initial solution was 29.4g; thus nearly 97%
of the nicotine passed through the packing.

After the second washing with water, the packing was air-dried for
packing was slurried with about 30ml 95% ethanol and filtered by suction.
The packing was rinsed with two 10- ml portions of ethanol, at which point
the packing was colorless. After drying the packing weighed 19. 5g, probably
due to mechanical loss. The yellow ethanol solution has a rich tobacco
subjective evaluation in cigarettes as well.

Since this result is so promising, we plan to perform additional
experiments to evaluate the capacity of the 0-18 packing. An alternate
packing material is a styrene-divinylbenzene co-polymer.

We will order some of this material for studies to compare with the C-
18 data. The styrene-divinylbenzene packing can be used over a pH range of
1-14 whereas the 0-18 is limited to pH 3-6 by its chemical reactivity.

sample, submitted by J. H. Bell, were quantitated by HPLC (l).
The sample cigarettes were made of brown wrapping paper. An
earlier memorandum (2) on phenol results for the brown paper
cigarettes is invalid since the sample was incorrectly identi—

fied.

Three cigarettes per pad were smoked by a single port smoking
machine in J. H. Bell’s laboratory. The Cambridge pad containing
of isopropanol from the smoking laboratory. The isopropanol
extract was diluted with equal volume of 6% aqueous acetic acid
and analyzed for phenols. Results of the analyses are presented
in Tables I and II.

A review of the results based on wet tar suggested lower hydro-
quinone levels in the brown paper cigarettes compared to the
reference, 1725—89. The results of the brown paper cigarettes
were not consistent as seen from the relative standard deviations
being greater than 25%, whereas the control showed a relative

”Percent Tar Free” Claim On Cigarettes
V A recently developed line of marketing strategy for
low delivery cigarettes has.been to claim the brand as being
"ﬂ_ percent tar free," as opposed to using conventional FTC
tar values} In an article in Fortune (Page 121, November 17,
1980), Brown and Williamson explained that "percent tar free”
was derived by dividing the weight of tar in a puff by the
total weight of all material in a puff, including the dilution
air and the smoke stream. The smoke stream differs from the
dilution air because of the particulate phase and enhanced
quantities of the major combustion gases [carbon dioxide and
carbon monoxide). Cigarette dilution combines an air stream
with the smoke stream in a given proportion by volume and
passes the resultant nicotine through a cellulose acetate

,filter to remove a fraction of the tar, nicotine, and water.

The fraction of each component removed is different and depends
on the specific filter efficiency. The volume percent of the
gaseous components in the stream is not significantly changed
by the filtration because the particulate phase occupies such a
small perCentage by volume. An air particulate stream that is,
a 90-10% ratio by weight is a 99.9-0.l% ratio by volume, 7
because of the large differences in density between the gases
and solids. ’ - '

The weight percent of the smoke stream was evaluated using
Virginia and is shown in Column 3 of Table 1. These numbers
are in good agreement with previous results of M. E; Hobbs,
Invited Paper, CORESTA/TCRC, Williamsburg, Va. 1972. Combining'
these values with known molecular weights [Table 1, Column 2),
the volume percent composition of the stream is evaluated and is
shown in Column 4 of Table 1. This smoke stream is then combined
with the dilution air stream in a volume ratio (lDD—D):D, where
D is the cigarette dilution, to give the results shown in Column 6
of Table l. The volume percent of tar, nicotine and water
deliveries to the smoker has been assumed to be zero and is
certainly less than 1% for high dilution.cigarettes. The actual
volume percent of tar cannot be calculated without knowing the
filtration efficiency of the filter for the particulate phase,
whereas the gas stream composition is unaffected on passing
by two different methods. The tar weight is the value derived
experimentally by weighing the Cambridge pads from FTC smoking
and subtracting nicotine and water. Nicotine and water weights
are derived by extraction techniques on the Cambridge pad.

result in‘a cigarette having‘the desirable "low ignition“
ignition” properties the cigarettes smoked very bland and were
undesirable when‘compared to a control Newport,

A blend containing 30% Burley/Flue cured PyT. with increased
casing and recasing was developed to make the modified cigarette
smoke comparable to a control Newport. This combination in
addition to the low Coresta cigarette paper yielded approximately
a 35-40% increase in CPM. Higher filtration and air dilution‘was

were also developed using the same blend, casing and recasing
modifications.

Based on the Product Development panel tests the test samples were
found comparable to the controls.

Extinguishing Cigarettes" Project 8-337. As of December, 1990
this project will be referred to as "Low Ignition Propensity

Cigarettes.

Five experimental cigarettes were submitted for examination by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) andlenergy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS).
The cigarettes were labelled‘as follows (Appendix I):

Virginia‘Superslims

ABE-1 35% Mg (on) 2

X8D9 ABC CaCO3 with liner
AB? 15% Mg(OH‘)2 with liner

The ash, char-line, unburned paper and liner of the samples were
structural features and on‘the elemental compositionlof the above sampies.

Virginia‘Superslims

The gross morphology of the ash appeared to be uniform in composition
and texture (Fig. 1). It contained dense aggregates of equant-shaped
particles which measured 0.4mm - ium in diameter. The surface of the
particles, as shown under high magnification, were either smooth or rough
(Fig. 2). The particles with a rough surface may be further broken down
into finer unit particles. The unburned paper contained high amounts of Cat
containing particles (Figs. 3, 4).. These particies appeared to have
metamorphosed dramatically through the burn since similar structures were
not visible in the ash. Similar results were obtained from the study done
on the K succinate Gacetate) containing papers by Gia Kim YiL. The char—
line on both sides of the paper containedlbubbles and crusty structures as
shown in Figsr 5 and 6. These structures were abundant at the char-line,
and were similar to ones found in‘the K—containing papers discussed‘by Gia
Kim‘Yil. There may be a heat—sensitive coating material present which
expands and bubbles as heat causes the release of gases; The crusty
structures may form as the bubbles cool.

The liner contained a low number of particles compared to the paper, and had
a smooth‘appearing surface. Major element31detected by EDS were Ca and K
from the ash and‘paper (Pig. 8), and Ca‘ﬁrom the liner.

This memo reviews the study design and rationale behind conducting a
package design test which includes Leo Burnett's suggested pack for PM

Blues. -

While an ad/pack test is planned, a package design test would provide
Marketing with results in a shorter time frame and serve as an early
read of smoker interest and choice within the packaging alternatives.

“iThe test would follow the same format as previous Blues pack test. 300
full flavor menthol smokers would be interviewed with 75% 18-34 years of
age and 25% 35-54 years of age. The sample would be evenly divided by

Eligible respondents would be exposed to each of the three packs, one at
a time, on a rotated basis. Following the exposure and rating-of the
packs monadically, participants would be shown the three Blues packs "~
side—by-side and questioned as to their preference and reasons why.
Consumers would then be exposed to a few unfinished ads; more
specifically, just pictures of people smoking, and then they would be
asked to select the one pack which best fits with the pictures of the

people.

Daniel, I will need six sets of packs. I already have the ad pictures
needed for this test.

DETA ILED FINDINGS
BA CKGROUND/METHODOLOGY

The primary objective of this research was to further learn about Generation Xers.
To achieve this objective, two focus groups were held among 18-24 year old
Miles and females in Englewood,NJ. on June 3, 1994.

Respondents were asked to discuss a number of issues, including:

- What they think Generation X is all about

- Factors that unite and/or inﬂuence their generation

generation

- Segments into which their generation can be divided and how those segments
can be identiﬁed :

Towards the end of the groups,respondents were shown a number of print ads
population. They were then questioned about why the ads were for these
speciﬁc groups,with a special focus on ads that they felt were for them.

SUB/[MARY OF FlNDl¥§

These young adults view their generation as diverse,having varied interests and
differences enable Generation Xers to have friends who are interested a variety of
things and lead lives that are not the same as their own.

Despite the diversity found among these young adults, Generation Xers do
appear to share certain attitudinal and behavioral characteristics. Speciﬁcally,
these shared characteristics are that they:

- Resist segmentation and labeling

- Are self-focused

- Have mistrust for the news media

— Show marketing savvy

- Like to try new things and experience life

- Believe ﬁnancial security is important but is not their ultimate goal

Respondents in both groups had heard of the term "Generation X", with some
indicating that the termhad negative connotations. Speciﬁcally,one young
woman stated that Generation Xers "...supposedly don't care about anything."

Subject: Pulper Discharge Pumps - Line 3

stggug

A plan to test two alternative types of stators on the Line 3
Netzsch Pulper discharge pumps (memo attached for ref.) was ap-
proved and the purchase-requisition submitted in mid-December.

As part of the recently implemented Omnibus purchasing process,
these items now must be ordered from Netzsch through Ferguson En-
terprises rather than from the local Netzsch factory rep., Wood
Equipment. I was informed by Wood's sales rep. Friday 1/14/94
that the order had not been placed. According to Ferguson, as of
1/21/94, the stators are on order and delivery will be expedited.
Ordinarily delivery is 6-8 weeks.

Recommendation:

I would like to add an additional evaluation to this testing
plan. This would be to install one of the next larger size of
the Netzch pump (Model NE90A) on Line 3 for a direct comparison
with the existing smaller model (NEBOA). This would enable us to
determine if the larger pump is worth the additional cost in
terms of extending pump life. The existing drive and motor from
the smaller pump can be reused so the primary difference between
the two models is the stator and rotor size. The additional cost

per pump (with the standard Ethylene Propylene (EP) stator and
316 SS rotor) is $1908.

Subject: wiegand Evaporator Evaluation status - 5/18/92

Turbofan operation

Fan vibration was monitored relative to daily fan washes and
results indicate that the spray nozzle does reduce turbofan
vibration in some cases. For example, on 5/14 fan vibration
decreased from 5.7 mm/sec to 3.7 mm/sec after the fan was cleaned.
Investigation work is continuing to assess the feasibility of

caustic or citric spray to the fan and to determine the need for
surge protection in our system.

Cleaning of the Evaporator

% acid and % caustic using‘ the automatic titrator at Bermuda
Hundred. WHA test.request has been completed to begin baseline"
testing. However, due to the Memorial Day shutdown and CIP

schedules, the sampling has been delayed and is estimated to begin
on 5/29.

A detailed review of the citric acid product data sheets and
material safety' data sheets has revealed that there are some
potentially significant differences between Nalco, Chemtreat, and
Industrial citric acids. The Nalco and Chemtreat citric acids

pulled for further evaluation.

In order to further determine the source and amount of particulate
materials in the system, plans are to open the top of the
evaporator and clean/inspect the distribution plates prior to a
CIP, immediately after a CIP, and three days later prior to the

next CIP. This evaluation will be conducted as
production/maintenance schedules allow.

Baseline solubles testing of the individual passes was conducted
from 4/29 through 5/7. The results are summarized in the attached
table. Each set of data represents the time between a CIP. The
results indicate very repeatable performance of each pass. The
results are being evaluated relative to the number of tubes in each

monitor the process for changes.

The objective of the work is to develop a PM process for refractory papers
which are badly needed for the sidestream and Delta programs.

The proposal is a modest one but I have great confidence in Dr.
Zallen's scientific ability in this area. I strongly recommend we support
this effort. This work did not apear on the 1988 originial budget but can
be supported out of the unused Visiting Scientist budget.

Please let me have your comments on this proposal.

Subject: . Meeting Minutes - Park 500 NPDES Permit

A meeting was held at Park 500 on August 14 at 2:00 to
discuss the draft NPDES wastewater discharge permit received
from the State Water Control Board.

Attendees:
G. L. Hill W. E. Poorbaugh
B. E. Honts J. N. Tenhet
J. J. Petchul J. T. White

W. P. Pitts

The following is a brief summary of the major issues dis-
cussed at the meeting. Any attendee wishing to correct or
add to these minutes should contact the author.

1. Phosphorus (P) is the only controlled parameter which
has both a mass (in pounds) and a concentration (in
place a cap on our maximum flow. The P concentration
limit is fixed by state regulation at 2.0 mg/L but we
should ask the SWCB to drop the P mass limit or
increase it if we plan to increase our flow.

2. The question concerning growth at Park 500 and waste-
water plant expansion for the next five years must be
addressed immediately. Unless we request additional
flow in September, we will be committed to our existing
ated and possibly until more wastewater treatment
capacity is added. state rules and attitudes and Park
year. Three years ago we were able to start construc-
tion on the Bermuda Project without waiting nine months
for a permit. We will not be able to do that again.

It is important to use this occasion to expand Park
500’s treatment capacity if there will be justifiable
need in the next five years.

FROM: Laurie Moroz

RE: Definition of Threshold Perception Index

.-—--—--—————-—-.-.--_————.-.----—_—-—--.u——-—————.—------—-----—-——-——-—---——-—-

The Fhreshold Perception Index is an expression of the probable stopping
power of an outdoor ad. It is a measurement of the average number of elements
correctly identified by respondents after viewing the ad at the threshold
exposure (which varies from .2 to .8 seconds). The Index is computed as follows:
Every element recalled by every respondent is assigned one "point;" in addition,
one point eachiis given for correct brand name and product identification.

All respondents' points are then accumulated, averaged, and expressed as a

percentage. (Elements of an ad consist of headline words or phrases, as well
as pictorial elements.)

For example, if a respondent, after threshold exposure, claims to have seen
"a pack of True cigarettes and a 5," his_answer constitutes five points - one
point each for the pack, the word‘”True”, and the "5“, and one point eachifor
correctly identifying brand and product. If the average number of elements re-

called by respondents for that ad was 4.86, the Threshold Perception Index would
be 486%.

The norm of 400% was developed throughicorrelation of Communicus' pre-testing

andlpost—test data. (Post-testin Testimates the number of people who have noticed
an outdoor ad in the marketplace.? 'An ad which earns a Threshold Percention

.Index of 400% or more is likely to perform well in Conmunicus' post-testing,

ie. is likely to be above average in attracting attention under actual viewing
conditions, “

It is theoretically possible for an ad tolreceive no correct brandlidenti-
fication, but still have a Threshold Perception Index of 400% or more. This is

unﬂikely since recognition of the brand name is usually worth two "points" in
"the Index. However, if such a situation did occur, it would probably meanithat

the ad had excellent stopping power, but that it attracted attention with strong,
creative elements which had little or nothing to do with the brand itself.

It is important to remember that the Threshold Perception Index is merely

suggestive of actual performance and must always be evaluated within the context

10: L. H. Gains
FROM: M. E. Viso

SUBJECT: Experimentation Using Charcoal to Remove Nitrogen

In an earlier memorandum, I outlined work using charcoal impreg-
nated with 1.3—butadiene as a filter additive to reduce nitrogen
charcoal or butadiene impregnated charcoal had lower Nox delivery
than cigarettes containing no charcoal. The question arose as to
whether NOX delivery could be reduced using untreated charcoal
and whether NOx delivery was related to the amount of untreated
charcoal used.

Experimentation has been carried out to address these issues.
The results from this experimentation seem to contradict the
previously obtained data that N0x delivery can be reduced using
charcoal filters. No reduction in N0x delivery was seen using
untreated charcoal. Additionally, no relationship was seen
between the amount of untreated charcoal used and the NOx deliv-
ery.

Two possible sources of this contradictory data include variabil—
ity of the method used to assay NOx delivery or inhomogeneity in
the nitrate content of the tobacco in the experimental ciga-
clarify the results.


A carton of 1188-93 cigarettes was removed from the freezer and
allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. The cigaret—
tes were then weight selected and those weighing from 1.06 to
1.09 grams were retained. Calgon type PCB 12 X 30 mesh charcoal
was incorporated into the cigarettes. The charcoal was added by
removing the outer filter portion, placing the charcoal in the
cavity, and reinserting the outer filter portion. Any part of
the filter that extended beyond the tipping paper was cut off.
The amounts of charcoal incorporated into the filters were 50.
90. 140, and 180 milligrams. Controls containing no charcoal
were prepared by removing the outer filter portion in each

Cigarettes were machine-made from Marlboro filler
Reductions in TPMwand CO delivery have been found; confirming
data obtained on eight different tests of hand—made cigarettes
and an earlier test on machine-made cigarettes“ The cigarettes
are mild-tasting and do not appear to produce fiery particles.

Hand—made cigarettes were fabricated having a carbon
core derived fromwa laterally crimped cellulosic non-woven
sheet. No fiery particles were produced during smoking,
and the ash has the same appearance as a control cigarette
having no carbonxcore. This potentially low cost cigarette
is expected to provide reduced TPM and gas phase delivery
without sacrifice in taste. It could overcome the problem
of brittleness encountered with the shredded carbon filler.
The cigarettes may also serve asra research model for investi-
gation of combustion phenomena in the cigarette.

Studies continue in our efforts to correlate the chemistry
of smoking substrates such as burley stems and cellulose,
as a model, it has been discovered that carbonyl groups
produced by chemical oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups
undergo rapid decarboxylation‘at low pyrolysis temperature
(240°C). It is unlikely that the resultant product can
form levoglucosan, the primary initial degradation product
of cellulose. This may give some insight into‘an explanation
as to why oxidized cellulose produces milder smoker than
untreated cellulose. Other carboxyl groups, such as those
produced by air oxidation, are more resistant to decarboxyla—
tion. Aside from the informative value of this knowledge,
it presents a novel route toward the utilization of most
of the Briskin-type oxidized celluloses.

Work continued on providing samples of ozone treated
hurley stem material to J. Swain for subjective smoking
evaluation. Results to date indicate reduced harshness
of smoker Further studies are underway to ascertain the
effects of ammonium carboxylate groups in themselves and
in combination with reduction of carbohydrate molecular
weight. It has been found that the carboxyl content of

.Parliament History
Pursuant to our conversation, you will find attached several pages of a
report issued by the Research Center concerned with major changes in the

Parliament brand since the early l960‘s. Please check this information
and let me know if there are errors or deficiencies.
,,As we noted in our conversation, interest is centered on changes which
would be obvious to a consumer; for example, recess vs. no recess, changes

in tipping length or filter construction, single vs. dual filters and
length of filters.

Most important would be to supply information prior to l96l which,I trust,
will be in the Manufacturing Department‘s files.

Finally, a reminder that I have a deadline

of December l3 to have the infor-'
mation in my hands. ' ,

establish a joint Economic Commission under the State

CC:

Attached is a Federal Register notice (50 E5 8428,
March 1, 1985) announcing that the U.S. recognizes
Turkey as signatory on the GATT Subsidies Code. The
agreement was signed February 25, 1985. I am informed
that, in order for the U.S. to recognize a country under
the agreement, a bi-lateral trade agreement must be
reached that would have the following results: a
country (Turkey in this case) would agree to phase out
export sibsidies and in return the U.S. would entitle
the country to injury tests in countervailing duty and
anti-dumping regulations with the U.S. International
Trade Commission. Sources at U.S. Commerce Department
indicate Turkey desired the protection afforded by the

ITC injury tests and, therefore, agreed to phase out its
export subsidies.

The Government of Turkey has proposed to the United
States that annual economic consultations between the
considering such a meeting this year only. Under
Secretary of Economic Affairs for the U.S. Department of
Turkey on June 5 and 6, 1985. No decision will be made
regarding future economic meetings until the U.S.
reviews the initial consultations. state Department
sources say nothing exists on paper regarding the
proposed economic commission at this time.

We have been asked by sources at the ITA Turkey desk at

the Commerce Department if we have any problems or
points we would like to have raised at the tentative
June 5 and 6 meeting. If so, please contact me as soon
as possible. I understand the agenda is wide open at

this time.

BOLD 100's cigarettes were produced with low, target, and high RTD filters to
determine the effectiof filter RTD on total RTD and subjectives. A :13 mm
TRTD at equal ventilation resulted in comparable products. Filter acceptance
criteria were determined using this information and submitted to Filtrona.
Four pallets of BOLD 100’s filter rods were subsequently requested for use in
effects on manufacturing performance. These are scheduled to be completed by

June 7.
Results of the product placement test conducted in Northern Virginia/Maryland
indicate that BOLD is rated more favorably than Carlton/Now on several
liking—related scales. When compared to the 1990 study, the current white-
tipped BOLD was rated as smoother, less harsh and less irritating than the
previous BOLD model. . —

100, each model gave approximately 70% reduction on the 8—port instrument.
Conversion to the single wrap is expected at the end of May.

Fillers): Plans have been formulated for the preparation of preliminary
magnesite cigarette models in different configurations to provide baseline

magnesite paper (45 g/m?, ternary) which gives highest SS visibility

reduction on a typical Lotus-type cigarette and the magnesite paper (55 g/m?,
binary) which gives preferred subjectives.

Cigarettes were made with magnesite papers from Ecusta at higher citrate
levels than previous samples. The two 45 g/m? ternary base sheet models gave
about 70% reductions in sidestream visibility compared to Marlboro Lights;
two 55 g/m? binary models with slightly different base porosities and one 45
g/m? binary base sheet model gave 50—60% reductions. The ash flaking on the
ternary papers was considered excessive.

Subject: Project Case Compilation of "Filter Material" Responses
The panel was composed of ten employees, ﬁve females and ﬁve males. Three of the
women were given the paper ﬁlter, while two received plastic ﬁlters. The reverse was
given to the men. The test took place on Thursday, May 12 and on Friday, May 13.
We did not originally plan for two days but due to "technical difﬁculties", the ﬁlters for
the superslim cigarettes were not ready until Friday. Therefore, those smokers
participated on that day, while all the other smokers performed the test on Thursday.
One ﬁlter was given to each person and they were instructed to use this ﬁlter for the

day and if for some reason they needed another one, they could receive a new one.

below.

The overwhelming response for the open-ended question of "conunents/problems/issues"
was the functionality of the ﬁlter. With the exception of one person, all respondents
experienced difﬁculty in ﬁtting the ﬁlter on the cigarette. Other comments were: the
RTD was decreased; the ﬁlter made the cigarette too strong; the idea of putting a ﬁlter on

being felt while smoking.

As far as the "preferred" material, four participants out of the ﬁve that used the plastic
ﬁlter would prefer that type of material verses the paper. The female that did not choose
the plastic did not like the "slick" feel of the material. Another reason was that the
cigarette could possibly slip out of the mouth if not being held tightly with your lips. The
others said the feel of the plastic was pleasing. They also liked the sturdiness or ﬁrmness
of the plastic, and the lip release was good. This question was only asked to the plastic
ﬁlter users.

The paper ﬁlter users did not mention any particular thing that they liked about it, but

SUBJECT: PM USA Point of Sale Material Philosophy
Maintaining the competitive advantage that has been developed over time for our brand
trademarks is critical to their future success. Creating and placing POS which enhances the

added value of our brands is also critical and must be properly managed to ensure that our
overall corporate strategies and objectives are met.

To assist the field sales force in accomplishing these goals, the following clarifies our
corporate philosophy regarding POS and outlines initiatives currently under development.

Flex and Price Off Promotign PQS

As communicated previously on February 17. 1994 in Document 155, for the second quarter
and until further notice, all Flex Funds are to be used exclusively for running Marlboro Price
Off Promotions. Non-customized Marlboro Price Off POS will continue to be available in
support of these promotions.

Additionally, several types of custom Marlboro Price Off POS will also be available to
accounts that want to include their store name or logo.

To further support price promotion, whenever possible, a price call out space will be included
on B headers to communicate pricing.

Effective immediately the types of POS detailed above are to be used exclusively for
Marlboro Price Off Promotions.

antingous POS for all Brands

In an effort to upgrade all continuous brand POS, senior sales management will be
requested to identify ongoing requirements for at least four brands, excluding Marlboro.
Select POS items will then be produced and made available to the field. Details regarding
these items will be communicated under separate cover.

i I m 'x
our investment. As a result, ideal store layouts which illustrate the preferred placement of PM
USA POS and fixturing will be developed for each trade class. This information should be
used as a guide to achieve the desired PM USA look in each account.

Your support of this philosophy is imperative if we are to achieve a strong presence for our
brands. Together we can ensure that our brands are advertised in a manner that is
consistent with our long—term goals.

FYI, follows attached an article published today at “0 Estado de sac Paulo” about the
action moved against Souzs Cruz which ﬁrst articles I’ve sent you yesterday.

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Scum Cruz will win in
a second instance, considering that “111ng cigarettes is a legal activity.
Adversiting and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes marmfaoturing
activity even more legitime.“ One of the lawyﬂs who has be- consulted (Dr. Celso

An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Celidonio) questioned “how it could be possﬂzle to determine
ifthe smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life”. and still
complemented by saying that “if the person started to smoke as a kid, also his parents
should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also

provoque heart attacks”.

Only one attorney believes that "if it could be proven that the smoker only consumed
cigarettes ﬁom Souza Cuz and that his death was really a. consequence of the smoking
habit, the cause & effect relation would then be a ﬂeet”. This same attorney considered, at
the other hand, ese proves difﬁcult to be obtained.

Subject: Phili Morris USA’s Needs in Pa er Technolo . VA
 
A number of important issues facing Philip‘Morris can be addressed in‘
large part by means of paper technology. sidestream smoke‘reduction,
altered mass burn rate, spotting (both in ART and non—ART products), new
products and paper breakage during manufacturing all reflect current needs
which can be met via modification of the wrapper material itself. Future
needs might include the requirement for an exceptionally strong and flexible
paper, as cigarette-maker speeds advance to 10,000 units per minute, and
perhaps ultimately to 12,000 units per minute. Also, innovative new
prodUcts have requirements for very unusual papers.

ln the area. of sidestream smoke reduction, for example, modification of

' the cigarette wrapper has produced very good results. Low porosity papers
and those with very fine particle size inorganic fillers have been
successfully used as a: means of reducing sidestream smoke. R&D is currently
evaluating materials with different chemical and physical properties from
those used for rcaitine papermaking. Extremely high surfjace area calcium
carbonate (‘72 m /g vs. 7 m lg for normal paper and 22 m /g for "standard"

sidestream-reduction paper) has been obtained and is being tested. Initial
results are encouraging. Materials with different chemistries, such as
magnesium carbonate, have been tested with some initial sucée‘Ss. A variety

of mineral paper fillers will also be evaluated, along with several novel
synthetic inorganic compounds to be prepared by A. Kallianos and others
within and outside of R&D. Physical and chemical characterizafkion of
papermaking materials will also be performed, so that we can determine m
we observe what we do‘ and to gain: insight into‘ the mechanisms involved: 1,2 .

Alternate paper constructions are also being developed in the
'_both performance and subjective characteristics. Double—wrapping,

Laminating of sheets and preparing a layered or gradient sheet all are
techniques which can give us greater flexibility in addressing a number of
problems. Different materials can be placed in two sheets or in different
strata of the same sheet. B‘. Goodman has recently prepared1 double wrapped
cigarettes for the reduction of sidestream smoke3 . The outer wrap contained

the generally unpalatable Mg(OH)2 paper and the inner wrap contained? a low
porosity, low calcium carbonate sheet. Results have been quite favorable in

'both sidestream smoke reduction and subjective acceptability. This example

illustrates how the dual construction of the wrapper can offer a

Two samples of Boehmite, precipitated sol-gel, batch 001, were

and ground. The other sample was the feed sol—gel prior to centrifugation.

Both samples were mounted on carbon stubbs with carbon paint and

examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backseatter electron
The purpose of this examination was to determine if any metal flakes
from the stainless steel centrifuge vessel were present within the product.
selectively view differences in atomic number elements within a sample.

This is demonstrated by Figure l where a small piece of a stainless steel
razor blade was examined to serve as a control.

The feed sol-gel sample examined showed no metal (Figures 2—3). Energy
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was then used on the product to
determine if there was a high concentration of metals present. Al, the

constituent of the sol-gel, was the only element detected (Figure 4).

The product was then subjected to backscatter SEM. No metal flakes
were noted within the sample examined (Figures 5-8).

Newport is a heavily Urban Center driven brand, while its key
competition is either more evenly split between General Market and
Urban Center, or is. General Market driven. This creates a
disadvantage for Newport Lights, because the Lotar Menthol category
is heavily dominated by the General Market. Since Newport Lights
is underdeveloped vs. this target audience, we feel that there may
be an opportunity to build Newport Light’s business by increasing
the brand's presence in the General Market.

Therefore, starting April 8, 1996, we will implement a Newport
program is to determine business building opportunities for Newport
Lights in the General Market. The test will strive to increase
brand awareness and marketplace presence by utilizing a combination
of a distribution drive and increased/specialized marketing support
in the form of Advertising and Promotion.

The attached is the ﬁnal report for the Cambridge Advertising Development Mini-Groups
that were conducted in Phoenix, Arizona on January 11th, 12th and 13th. Fifteen mini-
groups were conducted among men and women, ages 25-49 who regularly smoke:
Cambridge/C-Store Private Labels/Distributor Brands or National Deep Discount Brands.
that would attract interest from the C-Store/Wholesale Competitive Discount Brands'
smokers and also would provide reinforcement to current Cambridge smokers.

It is important to note that research was conducted on the advertising prior to Phoenix: 33
in-depth interviews were conducted on December 14th and 15th in Minneapolis/St. Paul,
Minnesota among men and women, ages 25-54 who regularly smoke: Cambridge/Private
Label/Deep Discount. The objectives of this research were to determine the relevance of
two proposed campaigns ("Side by Side Comparison" & "Testimonial") to Cambridge and
B&W/PL smokers, and determine any negatives associated with either of the campaigns or
their speciﬁc executions. '

We;

The ﬁndings of both rounds of research were consistent. The overall ﬁnding being that
the comparison of Cambridge to Store Brands does not appear to be a relevant nor
compelling message to these smokers.

mo-kr

   

For the most part. these smokers appear to be content with what they are smoking. As a
result, the ads and concepts shown didn' t provide a motive to switch. The Cambridge
name did not provide an added advantage, warranting a higher price.

The term "Store Brand" does not appear to be relevant to consumers. The .
propositions/benefits conveyed in the concept statements/advertising were determmed to be
insigniﬁcant/not pertinent to these smokers.

For those not negatively predisposed to Cambridge’s taste, some of the claims about,
Cambridge would convert them to a purchase only if it was comparably priced to their
current low-priced brand.

WM

Cambridge smokers do not appreciate the frame of reference to low-priced brands, they see
their brand as being comparable to FM brands in terms of quality but they just pay less for
theirs.

CZRZOO AMA Activities Miscellaneous Activities


The analytical precision curve for the two-stage gold amalgamation system was further studied with a

concentration range from 0.1 ng up to 10 ng of Hg. As expected, the precision at the low concentration

was not as good as at the high concentration, 5.9 % RSD for 0.1 ng Hg verse 0.3 % RSD for 10 ng Hg.

0 The individual trap efﬁciency of 11 Au—Pt traps was studied by the purge-and-trap of 5 ng of Hg standard.
The maximum difference was found being less than 1% that indicates the precise set-up for the two stage

gold amalgamation system.

The trap efﬁciency of Au»Pt gauze was studied by connecting two Au-Pt traps in serial and the mercury
amount was analyzed independently. The amount of mercury breakthrough, based on the second Au—Pt

trap, was found to be 1% for 5 ng ong and 1.5% for 10 ng of Hg.

The instrument LOD, 0.011 ng, was determined based on 10 replicates of purge and trap of reagent blanks.

The method LOD, 0.1 ng, was also determined based on 10 replicates of smoking blanks.

3 ng of Hg was spiked onto the Au trap before smoking the 1R4F cigarette for method accuracy study.

Only 60% recovery of Hg was recovered, which can not justify the performance of gold trap. Two reasons

for this poor recovery, one is that the amount of Au was not enough to trap both mercury and volatile

organic vapor passing through electrostatic precipitation, and the other is the deactivation of the Au trap

caused by some organic vapor. To solve this problem, a catalyst converter is going to be placed before

gold trap to decompose organic vapor before the gas phase of smoke entering the Au trap.

Subject: CIGARETTES FOR ANALYTICAL SIDESTREAM RESEARCH

Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical
Reseapr h, and Cigarette Technology personnel, several cigarette
models; were designed specifically for research on sidestream smoke
compositio The objective for the upcom~.ng studies is to
investigatggghe effect of cigarette circumference and Mg(OH)2
wrapper. %rder to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes
were made at thr e different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24 8
mm) each with a standard commercial wrapper (Kimberly— Clark 156)
and with a 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from

the same batch of to acco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered
configuration. Egg

.
The selected blend was tﬁegcurrent project TRIM blend with standard
production components. DBC Br‘Iht, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RLTC
and RL 150B was used. It cont ed no stems or expanded tobaccos,
so that better looking ultra slim g arettes could be produced All
samples had the same casing and aﬁfgfcut system.
The Hauni lab max was used for all thre‘ circumferences. Cellulose
acetate filters were made with widely v rying efficiencies in an
effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries within reasonable
levels. The tables attached to this memo giv’ analytical data for
configuration gave extremely high RTD’s for nonventilated
cigarettes. This could have an effect on mainstream puffing to a
greater extent than for a standard circumference cigarette. Ultra
slim prototypes typically have RTD.!s above 6" water fag 45 — 55%

filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for
the slim cigarettes.

Tables II and III give the calculated differences in data for each
at standard circumference as controls.

tective measures being taken to control menthol loss.


During the early development work for Arctic Lights it was rec- u
ognized that some special precautions might be required to prevent
loss of menthol from filter rods. Dz. Heitkamp obtalned samples
from two trays of filter rods over a 5 day period and reported

a substantial loss of menthol (Dr. N. D. Heitkamn to D v. Cantrell,
April 17,1978). Dr.Heitkamp'srcport indicated only a very
slight loss of triacetin. . ,

from Arctic Lights filter rods. The first was a specially con-
structed filter rod tray which was totally enclosed on the top
and all four sides. The bottom fit flush with the shelf of a
tray trolley to form a nearly air tight container The second
method was a sealed tray trolley with plywood sides, top and
23nd felt gaskets.
 

A series of tests was designed to evaluate the various methods
of holding Arctic Lights filter rods.
