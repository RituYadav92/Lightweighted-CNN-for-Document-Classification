Weekly Highlights - Week Ending June 19, 1987

A review of pesticide regulations and regulatory toxicology as
described in a Council‘for ricultural Science and Technology
(CAST) document was prepargg‘by\§r. Robert Suber. The CAST
document provides a very simpl stig_ view of these areas
without defining both the strengths and weaknesses of science

and regulations. Risk assessment as currently used by the
Environmental Protection rAgency is only a part of the

scientific data needed to interpret risk and safety
considerations of pesticides. The CAST document had been
prepared to explain technica1.aspects and to provide general
background information on pesticides following the recent
National Academy of Science report on pesticides and risks.

The minutes of the quarterly Center meeting was distributed.
The most recent developments of Proposition 65 in California

were discussed. A court :apinion requires the California
animal or human carcinogens/teratogens. The recent National
Academy of Science report on pesticides was also reviewed.
The report provides a theoretical approach to oncogenic risks
due to pesticides and suggests that EPA review/require
Toxicology Program is preparing to test limonene and black
pepper in bioassays. Del Monte is currently evaluating the

Correction to minutes of February 12: Page 3 #5. Temperature
'recorders only shipped to Malaysia, no RH readings taken.

1. Malaysian shipment temperature readings returned —
shipment. Initial results show that Winston B

International. Salems have not been received as

yet. “More cigarettes will be examined.

2. Marlboro without TEG appears to spot worse than
‘ Marlboro with TEG under lOOOF/9ORH. Results appear

similar with the Houston cycle. It appears that

Marlboro resistance to spotting may be dropping
slightly. Meeting of domestic development personnel

- will be held on 2/27 to review spotting standards
for domestic products.

'3. Tobacco and blends - Flue cured, G7, G7A with and with—
out addition of humectants has little or no effect on
spotting.

Burley blends - slight effect — BB increases spotting-
slightly, B9 also.

Casing burley definitely increases spotting — increases*
when B3 added — B3 and 39 increases spotting still more.

AMF Filling Capacity Instrument

An AMF representative assisted in the performance evalua-
tion of the AMF in-line filling capacity instrument lo-
cated in G-13 Plant 63. Four different blends over a -
range of filling capacity values from 450 to 900 ml. /100
gm. were measured with the standard RJR filling capacity
methods. Mid-range filling capacity measurements were
acceptable, but range limit measurements indicated the
need for instrument adjustments. Software and instrument
setting were changed to improve the correlation between
the AMP unit and the RJR method. Testing will continue to
confirm instrument adjustments and to verify correlation
with production filling capacity values.

Optimum Strip and Cut Filler Particle Size

The ROM for the SCOPE Phase II making tests is ready for
review.

The cutting, verification tests which will use,blends of
three grades of burley, flue-cured and then add turkish
blend are being defined. Screening of the burley for this
test will be complete in mid-September and the flue-cured
screening will continue until November.

Processing begins this week at the J. I. Miller Stemmery,

1987 Federal Excise Tax Increase

provides a program recommendation to manage the impact of a

potential excise tax increase effective October 1, 1987.

I.

II.


 

Consideration will be given in the 100th Congress to
increasing the Federal Excise Tax on cigarettes in 1937.

RJR Public Affairs predicts that if an increase is in fact
legislated, there is a 70% probability it would take effect
October 1, 1987, and a 30% probability it would be effective
be either 8¢ or 10¢ per pack.

Depending on the timing and magnitude of an increase,
Industry volume is expected to decline 2.9% to 3.8% as a
result. These declines are incremental to the forecast
industry baseline trend (-1.7%). RJRT volume is estimated
to experience a commensurate decline with total Industry.
This estimate is based on the fact that RJRT currently has
its fair share, or 32.3% of the Savings Segment.
Consequently, RJRT is expected to maintain share.

versus the total Industry, it is expected that a significant
shift in Full Price vs. Savings Brand volume mix will occur.
For example, under an 8¢ increase effective 10/1/87
scenario, RJR Full Price volume is projected to decline
about 1.7 billion and Savings volume projected to increase
by .4 billion. The shift in mix is more demonstrative for
the full year 1988 as'Full Price volume is down over 10
billion units with Savings volume up almost 5 billion.

1987 Volume/Profit Impact

Volume and profit impact of an PET increase and recommended
action plan assume an 8¢ increase effective October 1, 1987,
since this scenario appears to be most likely. Sensitivity
analyses of other possible scenarios are included as

appendixes.
RJR volume is projected to decline 1,347MM units in 1987 as
a result of an FET increase with losses on full-price brands
offsetting gains on DORAL and CENTURY. This shift in mix
results in a negative profit impact of $29.6M.

Dear Doctor Conning:

The Council for Tobacco Research, as you are undoubtedly aware,
has been engaged for many years in studies to determine the biological
under acute and especially under chronic conditions. The best—known studies
from the program are those that have been published by Drs. Cecile and
Rudolph Leuchtenberger, now of Lausanne, Switzerland, who have been receipients
of Council grants-in—aid since 1957. There are, however a number of others

In 1965, we held a conference to review the devices and methodology
for such investigations, with a view to improving them and so standardizing
them as to increase the comparability of results obtained in different
laboratories. An account of this conference, the considerations that led to
its organization and of the conclusions reached, was contained in our Annual

Report for 1965-66. Certain pages from this report are attached hereto.

methods of using it have been further defined and refined subsequently during
the course of a program to compare critically the best devices that were
available at that time or that became available subsequently. An updated

statement of these criteria as we see them now is attached.

The study of these machines and of a new positive—pressure device
that was designed anew after the 1965 conference has led to development of a
relatively simple machine that meets most of the criteria that were set up
originally or added subsequently. A statement of its preSent status is attached.

Dr. Arthur Furst, Director of the Institute of Chemical Biology at
the University of San Francisco in California, has long been engaged in inhala-
tion research and has served The Council as a consultant in this field since the
1965 conference mentioned. He subsequently spent a sabbatical year with us
full-time as a consultant in this and other matters and, since returning to San
Francisco is again actively engaged in inhalation research under a Council

contract.

Dear Dr. Mohr:

with interest at an application concerning ETS exposure systems for in vitro

After reviewing your agreement with RJR, I noticed the termination
date was March 31, 1997. I have contacted our legal department to extend this

HiQ using your in vitro smoke exposure system would beneﬁt our continued

On behalf of the Los Augeles Hospitality Coalition. I wan: to thank you in ad-
vance for your support of our efforts to qualify a referendum overturning the Los Angeles
City smoking ban. If left unchallenged, the ban passed last week by the Los Angeles City

We hope that RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company will make a connibun'on in the
amount of $71,619.00. Please forward your check to the attention of Cary Davidson at 777
Figueroa Street, Suite 3400, Los Angeles, CA, 90017. As this effort is extremely time sensi-
tive, please have your check or wire to our ofﬁce or bank on July I, 1993 if at all possible.

Again. thank you for agreeing to help preserve a positive, competitive business
climate for the Los Angeles city hospitality industry.

Re: SALEM FULL FLAVOR Budget
Dear John:

I am enclosing the latest budget information for SALEM FULL
FLAVOR. Recap is as of September 5 and is based on:

a. August 25 revised budget information supplied by
Ms. B. R. Garner

b. Esty Media August 11 report issued to you earlier

0. Production spending in the light of management changes
to High Country, currently in progress
After inclusion of the mandatory $275M corporate reserve mini-
mum contingency, and $951M for spreads, the Brand has a nega—
tive net variance of $38M:


Net Budget Net Actual Diff.

16 MG. 12734 1,734 —~
Total: $1A,249M $14,287M (38)

The overage of $38M in total budget stems from a production
V$81M in space (See Exhibit 2).

The production average mainly results from:

a. Increased shoot and preparation costs previously dis—
cussed and reestimated, and additional work associated

b. Inclusion of Black and Ethnic print not included in the
last report.

Dear Mr. Cullman:

The Veterans Administration, the American Cancer Society and Doctors Auerbach and
evaluation of the Auerbach-Harnmond study on “The Eﬁects of Cigarette Smoking Upon Dogs” by a
panel of independent scientists chosen by you.

Your request is without precedent in the scientiﬁc community. The study under question was the
whose ﬁndings have been validated by distinguished pathologists of worldwide reputation. In addition,
other leading pathologists, highly regarded by the scientiﬁc community, have visited Dr. Auerbach’s
laboratory, seen his slides and praised the work.

We do not intend to ask that these two eminent men submit their ﬁndings to any selected
committee chosen by the Tobacco Institute, or any other group. Their work will be judged in the
traditional manner of American science, where ﬁndings are presented, discussed, accepted or rejected
by scientisu and physicians whose only motivation is the truth. Doctors Auerbach and Hammond
worked freely and without restraint with funds furnished by the federal government and the American
Cancer Society. They are beholden only to the scientiﬁc community at large and to the integrity
it represenu. .

If the Tobacco Institute, or any scientiﬁc research group, has doubts about the ﬁndings of this
study, the way it was conducted, or the credentials of the investigators, there is a time-honored and
scientiﬁcally accepted way to proceed. Let your own or another group of scientists repeat the '
experimenu in a laboratory to prove that smoking dogs will not suffer tissue damage, emphysema and
lung cancer. The Auerbach-Hammond methodology is readily available to you. And I presume that
in the Council for Tobacco Research you have or can set up the mechanism for conducting such a study.

If you carry out your plan to publicize "our respective positions" to the medical and lay public,
you have our permission to use this letter as the position paper of the American Cancer Society.

Pouch, even though you did not react favorably to them is no
reason why I may not yet work out a plan agreeable to you.

ﬁithout going into detail, I want to say that part of
the idea I have is an entirely new copy slant for Camel
Cigarettes. A copy note every bit as powerful as the maidor
Pack and nI'd walk a mile for a Canel'.

If that is so, and I assure you it is, undoubtedly you
will be interested in knowing what it is.

It will enable Camel to again capitalize the times -
with a new, sparkling, powerful and dramatic cepy angle -
one that fits Camel's like a glove. '

The idea, of which the copy note is part, can be
adopted to your present radio presentation, without die-
turbing it, in such a manner as to hold the Camel Radio
audience for a full hourafter you have left the air., It
provides a hook on which to hang your prograuu _ , ,

I have gone to considerable trouble and eXpense to
lay the idea out so that it can be quickly visualized, and
_ I believe, instantly appreciated, for what it is - a valuable
and important advertising idea.

Therefore, I am going to ask if you won‘t be kind

look the presentation over, if I mail it to you for your
quick reaction.

RJRT INTEROPFICE MEMORANDUM
Subject: Freon 123/Freon 11 Date: April 10, 1990
Residue Decay

Study in Packaged
Cigarettes

To: Michael F. Borgerding Prom: Rhenda H.'Stee1e

At RJRT, once tobacco is expanded, this tobacco can be used to
make cigarettes in approximately two to six hours. Once
cigarettes are made, the cigarettes can be in the consumer's hand
in as little as three to four weeks, although the industry
average is three to four months. With these times in mind, the
following sampling points have been chosen for the packaged
cigarette residue decay study:

Day 0 (remove cigarettes from freezer)
Day 1

Day 4

Day 7 (1 week)

Day 14

Day 21

Day 28 (1 month)
Day 42

Day 56 (2 months)
Day 70
Day 84 (3 months).

These data are needed in order to estimate smoker exposure to
Freon 123 by the August decision date. It is understood that
this study will probably need to be repeated once PT&D optimizes
the Freon 123 expansion process in order to obtain a more
accurate curve for consumer exposure assessment.

Additional perchlorates were assayed by the following procedure:
Approximately 0.5 g. of sample was weighed into a lOO-ml. volumetric
flask and dissolved in 10 ml. of water. This solution was diluted to

Dear John,

Thanks for your letter. I have reviewed Tims report as well as
Pats latest progress noﬂZto me.you will find enclosed a copy of my advice
to Pat. I am very interested in knowing what antiserum Chick Turner used
for the CF test. We may need to use the anti-hamster leukemia virus serum
for all our testing. Positive results would be very provocative.
I am now in the process of arranging my charter flight to
California in November. I have obtained a ticket on a plane arriving
in San Francisco about November 10.

I had one idea which may make our meeting more convenient
for you and at the same time enable me to visit NIH to get some supplies
and finish up some paper writing there. Is it possible for CTR to pay my trip
from San Francisco to New York ? I would leave the ﬁbnday after the
conference (hbvember 15). We could spend one or two days together and . I
then I'll go down to Washington. I can get a charter flight from New
York to Paris very easily but must make a reservation very soon.

If you prefer meeting me in California, I shall reserve the
return flight from there, Await your reply.

Looking forward to talking with you.

Have lots to share with you.

Best regards.

HR. R. A. mp}: ‘ Q")?


It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of
Finance is likely to tax SPA as a cigarette. This
unfortunate news comes as a result of a preliminary report
from the Customs Laboratory to the HOP.
In a meeting this morning with three MOP officials, w.
Dembach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had
analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and were
to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the M0? to
classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a

cigarette tax rate.

It was stated at the meeting that this report was
preliminary and is not binding on the HOP. However, w.
Dembach did not see any indication that the HOP would rule

differently.

The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under '
Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance,
Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the
department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich
(the official directly in charge of RJR's request). Absent
from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s

superior and has been an advocate of RJR’s position.
Wilfried’s read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not
been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a

major factor in the HOF’s decision.

Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could
be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He
went on to say that the political issues of SPA's investment
value and social benefits were of no concern to the MO? in
its interpretation of the law. In light of this, Wilfried
believes that Mr. Dittrich will feel encouraged to

recommend a cigarette tax rate.

Dear Susan:
i k E1' in — A'r ‘
I am sorry about my delay in writing about this filter and in truth have
little to say about it.

There are several high efficiency filters available that work on a similar
principle, i.e., prefilter, high efficiency particle filter, then charcoal
absorbent material. They are indeed efficient and efficiencies of 95 to 98%

for smoke particles are usual claims (LR&G’s 99.6 to 99.9% seems
unnecessarily ambitious). The odor elimination efficiency of 88% is also

higher than most manufacturers claim, but only tests would confirm or
disprove this data.
I suspect that the real problem will be an operational life. Airline particle
filters apparently clog fairly quickly and need to be changed frequently. If
one inserts a more efficient filter, I would expect it to clog more quickly

and would expect high pressure drops through the filter. This, however. is
again subject to proper trials.

I do, however, find it hard to believe that their layer of "charcoal paper”
would last long as an odor controller. Banks of charcoal rapidly loose
efficiency as absorbers of odors and need frequent replacement. and their

hours, never mind the 3,000 to 6,000 hour claim.

I would like to think these would work as well as they claim. but I doubt
it.

Kindest regards,

ﬂ

RJR Interoffice Memorandum

Evaluation of Vantage Excel
100 Cigarettes Prepared with
Low Sidestream Paper Containing
Boron

TO: Dr. John H. Reynolds, IV FROM: Patricia F. Perfetti

I would appreciate consideration by you and the HRRC of the following proposal
to request consumers to smoke Vantage Excel 100 and one test VRP prototype

Background:

Vantage Excel 100 entered test market January 31, 1989. Although consumers
are very enthusiastic about the taste and product concept, numerous written
and verbal complaints have been received by RJRT regarding the "messy,
immediately to insure the success of the brand. Two prototypes (described
intent of improving ash cohesiveness.

Need For Human Subjects:

Unbiased human subjects are required in order to determine if the ash
improvements demonstrated by either prototype are significant enough to be
noticed by the typical consumer.

Scientific Affairs Review:

 

Memorandum attached (Rhenda Steele to Pat Perfetti, March 10, 1989). The
conclusion is that boric acid and sodium tetraborate decahydrate are approved
for further review by the HRRC. Also, attached is information from the U.K.
Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (Fourth Report, 1988).

SUbWCﬂ Status Report NL Project Data February 25, 1976

To: Mr. D. P. Johnson Fronu A. J. Sensabaugh, Jr.


Project Title: NE

Summary:

Regular and menthol NL—type cigarettes have been developed and
submitted to Marketing for their evaluation. These cigarettes were
designed to deliver 17 mg. "tar" and .15 mg. of nicotine. Various
blends, top-dressings,and processing changes were evaluated to reduce
the off taste and off aroma associated with the M-2000 process for
nicotine removal. Although some reduction of the off taste and off
aroma have been accomplished by removing the burley tobacco from the
blend, changing from freon to pentane, modifying M—ZOOO processing
conditions, and improved top-dressing, a definite off taste and off
sidestream aroma in the smoke is still present. The off flavor and
undesirable sidestream aroma are apparently inherent to the M—2000
process.
Future work on this project will depend upon Marketing's

Memorandum:

Initial testing of various types and grades of tobacco showed that
the MrZOOO process did change the smoking characteristics of the tobaccos.
The processing is more detrimental to burley tobacco than flue-cured
tobacco in that the level of off taste and off aroma are greater. Evaluations
of various grades of tobacco than were M—ZOOO processed showed the stronger
grades reduced in strength and having smoking characteristics closer to
the milder grades. All grades evaluated had a distinct Mr2000 taste and
aroma. All these observations were made using tobaccos processed in the
freon system.

Initial evaluations of WINSTON—type NL cigarettes versus a WINSTON
"Control" showed the WINSTON "Control" numerically favored in flavor

shown in Table I.

Breast Tumorigenesis“. This grant was previously assigned a
#4520. The new proposal represents a revised version of the
previous grant.

The two reviewers had the following comments on our previous 7
grant (#4520). The first reviewer was extremely enthusiastic abobt
our project. He considered the proposed methodology novel, ,
predicted that it would be successful, and recommended the proje t
for funding. The second reviewer, on the other hand, expressed i
concerns about the P.|.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches.
Per the first reviewer's comment, indeed we have successfully used
positional cloning approaches and cloned BRCAZ gene as proposed in
our previous application. To address the second reviewer's concern
about the P.l.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches we have
of BRCA2 gene. Since the submission of our previous grant
application we have cloned the gene, and hence the revised proposal
has entirely different emphasis, i.e. to characterize the tumor
suppressor activity of BRCA2 gene.

We hope that the reviewers will favorably consider this revised
proposal and give the RI. an opportunity to continue this exciting
area of research

Possible Modifications in Cigarette

_______________________________________________

Dear Ms. Crawford:

Enclosed are the responses of R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company as requested by the Commission on
April 13, 1983. We appreciate this opportunity to
comment.

We urge as a first priority that the Commission
immediately adopt a modification in methodology to
adjust for the new variablelintroduced~into~cigarette
"tar" and nicotine testing by "Barclay-type" or
"bypass" filters. The Commission's inquiry into
"bypass" filters has lasted long enough. It is time
for.action and results.

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has not yet
finalized its position on Question 7, which raises
broad questions concerning "smoker compensation." In
passing, however, two points should be made on this
subject. First, no two smokers will smoke cigarettes
in the same manner. In fact, the same smoker will
rarely smoke any two cigarettes in the same manner.
Therefore, as the Commission itself has frequently
all its varieties. For the Commission to allow
further delay in adjusting its methodology for "by-
pass" filters while it attempts to resolve the myriad
questions related to "compensation" and human smoking
would be unthinkable.

NOW LN 100 Prototypes

Test products have been released for an upcoming Product/Concept test of NOW
100 prototypes for the NOW low nicotine project. The objective of this
development pathway has been to reduce the smoke nicotine yield versus the
both prototypes which were roduced for this consumer testing. Prototype #1
utilizes a blend composed so ely of low nicotine off-shore tobacco. This product
achieves a smoke nicotine reduction of just over 50%. Prototype #2 uses the same
base blend except that the Part II burley and ﬂue-cured was denicotinized on the
FS-2001 pilot line with a double pass to simulate a single pass through #605. This
product achieves a 63% reduction in smoke nicotine. Mailout of the test products
occurred the week of 4/17; results are due 6/5. A Fourth Quarter 1989 test
market introduction is planned.

VANTAGE LN 85 Prototypes

The objective of the VANTAGE LN pro am is to design products which deliver

50% less nicotine than conventional FFL cigarettes. Two of the developed
prototypes are variations of the VANTAGE 100 blend, while the third proto e is

Thank you very much for your letter concerning our FACT advertising.
We realize that the proper grammatical construction is "I smoke only

our copy line conveys. In order to personalize the choice of brand

to the model being presented in the ad, we have chosen the line "I'm
Since the subject of the advertisement 15 FACT cigarettes and only
FACT cigarettes, it goes well beyond the connotation of the ad to imply
that the only thing the model does is enjoy our brand of cigarettes.
Our marketing research indicates that consumers reading this adver-
tisement appear to receive exactly the intended connotation in the
communication — that is, that the model portrayed has made an
informed judgment on his brand of cigarettes and has chosen "to
smoke only rACTS. " Our feeling is that the American public has
come to understand over the years that advertisements typically
assume "poetic license" in order to convey their selling messages
and further feel that they can make a dichotomy between advertising
use of language and the exactly proper grammatical construction.

Again, thank you for your letter and we hope that, if you are a smoker,
you will try our FACTS and see if you do not agree that they deliver
atypically good taste for a low 'tar' cigarette.

muscular and metabolic disorders (including diabetes) In addition, considerable interest is
starting to focus on mitochondria as targets for a wide range of drugs, including benzodiazepines,
immunosuppressants, channel blockers, and nucleoside analogs. Because of the renewed interest in
this "old" organelle, the meeting is attracting a distinguished group of front— line researchers to
present their latest work.

The reputation and visibility of the Albany Conference series have grown with each meeting over
the past 11 years. However, as with all ventures of this type, we rely heavily on outside sponsors
support from private organizations such as yours, who have a vested interest in promoting
biomedical research.

The Albany Conferences are unique in many ways, including their intimate nature and inter-
disciplinary focus. The audiences have been savvy and appreciative of the chance to exchange
have helped to make each meeting possible. '

This is a request that you consider helping us make the 1996 Albany Conference on Frontiers of
Mitochondrial Research a success with your sponsorship. We are seeking contributions in the
range of $500 to $5,000. Higher level contributions carry perks such as single-room
accommodations for scientiﬁc representatives (registration fee waived) and full-page sponsor
acknowledgements in the meeting program (design of your choosing but no product advertising).
Certainly, we would also be pleased to receive smaller contributions, all of which will be
recognized at the meeting and in the ﬁnal program.

Summary 3

The initial mean value for acceptance using a 9-point hedonic scale
was 5.67 (6= like slightly). By the end of two weeks this mean score
had dropped to 5.16 (5= neither like nor dislike). The attribute
ratings identified problems with strength. odor and performance that ,
could be correlated to decline in acceptance. Some subjects did comment on ;
their impression that they felt better during_the period they were

smoking the product. ‘ ' -

Background

There were three groups of Human Study subjects who completed periodic
evaluations of their perceptions of the product during the periods
when they were smoking the test product . The evaluations included
the measurement of Overall Acceptance and 16 attributes related to
performance. usage. flavor. strength. and odor (ballot is attached).
The subjects also provided written comments. The 31 subjects who '
evaluated the test product for two weeks. completed three evaluations
(Groups Si and $2). The twelve subjects who evaluated the product for
39 days. completed five evaluations($3 Group). The data were analyzed
for all subjects of Groups 51. $2 and $3 for three intervals. The
subjects in Group S3 who provided five evaluations were also analyzed

previously.

Results of Three Intervals for All Subjects

Test conditions varied for the three groups of subjects. The Si and 82
Groups were both on the diet but smoked the product during different
two week periods. Males and females were represented in both groups.
The S3 Group was not on the diet and smoked the product for 39 days.
The 53 Group was comprised of males only. The results were analyzed
for group and interval effects. Group effects were not a major source
of information.

The three interval results indicate that 12 of the 16 attributes and
changes exhibited by these attributes were viewed in one of-two ways.
First. as a movement in the score that would represent a change in

sponsor the third FASEB Summer Research-Conference on the "Physiology and
Pathophysiology of the Splanchnic Circulation", which will be held at Copper
Mountain, Colorado on July 26-31, 1992. This conference will tentatively have
sessions on the following topics: ' . ’

Session I Chemical Modulators of Gastrointestinal Blood Flow

Session'IIIr Molecular and Cellular BaSis of Microvascular Functions

Session IV The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury:

Session VII Hepatic Circulation and Metabolism
Session VIII Alcohol Effects on the Liver and G. I. Tract

Session IX Portal Hypertension

The philosophy and goals of the meeting are un.ique. V In addition to bringing
together clinicians and basic scientists with interests in disorders of the

. splanchnic organs, the meeting will bring traditional investigators of the

splanchnic circulation together with investigators using more cellular or
molecular techniques. Thus, we hope to identify potential new reSearch areas
and to stimulate interdisciplinary research efforts. As the Conference

Chairman, .I would like to invite approximately 50 eminent investigators to
speak at the meeting, and I want to encourage a number of promising young
investigators to vattend, by paying their expenses. Although both the American
Gastroenterological Society and FASEB have endorsed the conference and have
provided generous financial support, I still need about $15, 000 to ensure that
the meeting is a scientific success The funds will be used exclusively for
support of eminent clinical and basic Science investigators‘ meeting costs

($MOO) and travel expenses (between $HOO and $1000 for domes-tic and foreign
participants).

In addition, if any of the members of your organization would benefit from ,
attending the conference, please bring the opportunity to their attention. , As

ILLINOIS WHOLESALER LETTER #3

October 12, 1993
Gale A Held, Director

State Prevention Systems Program
Center for Substance Abuse Prevention

5600 Fishers Lane

Rockville, Maryland 20857

Dear Ms. Held:
As a wholesaler in Illinois, I am very disturbed about the Department of Health and
Human Services’ (HHS) proposed rules regarding the sale or distribution of tobacco
products to minors under Section 1926 of the Public Health Service Act. I would like to
take this opportunity to articulate some of my concerns.

As you may know, the Illinois state legislature has already dealt effectively with this issue
by attaching criminalpenalties to the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors.
Furthermore, retailers, wholesalers and other businesses in the state work very hard to
ensure that they comply with the law. I am offended that HHS assumes we have fallen
down on the job and has decided to take matters into its own hands (without the consent
of Congress) by proposing new, excessive regulations.

How does HHS propose to pay for these regulations? On the backs of small businesses
and retailers who already carry a tremendous regulatory burden. HHS estimates that the
proposed rules will cost $150 million in compliance law-enforcement costs. As I
licensing fees. These fees are unfair and could potentially jeopardize the health of
Illinois' struggling small business community.

Finally, I strongly disagree with the use of children and "private entities" for law
enforcement purposes. How can HHS suggest that young children be used in "sting"
dangerous. As for "private entities", I have faith that the law enforcement ofﬁcials in
Illinois can do the job of enforcing the laws. I do not want to put that responsibility in
the hands of private vigilantes.

Thank you for taking my comments into account.

Sincerely,

Dear John:

Walton-Morrissey Smoking Machine, demonstrated at the March 9 meeting.

It is obvious that considerable thought and effort has gone into
bringing the machine to its present state of development. From a
mechanical viewpoint the design is simple, straightforward, and should
require minimum maintenance. There are several design features I
would like to comment on, some of which were discussed at the meeting.

The design of the inhalation chamber is such that smoke distribution
within the chamber is a function of the smoke entrance velocity and
the dilution air stream. Since the entrance velocity is constant, as
the dilution air is decreased, the effective distribution must, there-
fore, decrease. After the two second puff is terminated, the smoke
begins to age for an interval equal to the exposure time. Due to the
chamber design it also begins to settle to the bottom of the chamber
where the concentration is increased. Dr. Rosenkrantz commented that
animals in the lower area always expire first. Only a long term study
would establish a definite pattern.

During the meeting, attention was brought to the close proximity of
the cigarettes to each other. Dr. Rosenkrantz was to determine if the
free burn rate is changed due to radiant heat. The current holder
restricts the spacing of the cigarettes. As I pointed out to you at
the time, 70 mm dia. Cambridge pads are available which would permit
the cigarettes to be moved further apart.

Robert E. Oswald, Ph.D.
Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine
Ithaca, New York 14853—6401
Dear Dr. Oswald:

The Council for Tobacco Research, USA, Inc. (CTR), is pleased to offer you a new grant in the amount
of $70,000 (including indirect costs) for the period from July I, l994 through June 30, 1995 for the study
proposed in your application "Molecular Mechanism of Nicotine Action on CNS Acetylcholine Receptors."
It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by institutional authorities. We recognize that
this appropriation is somewhat less than you requested, but hope it will sufﬁce to maintain your study at a
productive level. If you wish to accept it, please notify us accordingly and submit the enclosed revised
budget sheet to show how the available funds will be distributed. A new budget sheet is enclosed for this
purpose. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap with applications to other
agencies. If the latter result in awards, we should be notiﬁed promptly so that we can negotiate an
appropriate adjustment of our award.

. The award is made without guarantee of support beyond June 30, 1995, even though we recognize that
your original application proposed a study extending two years beyond that date. Therefore, if by November
30, 1994 you submit to us a formal renewal application, including a report of your progress, your request
will receive consideration.
the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me. Please contact Drs. Harmon McAllister and
Arthur Eisenberg of our scientiﬁc staff on matters concerning your grant and keep us informed about the
progress of your study.

As Principal Investigator, you should know that CTR recovers unexpended balances over $1,000 at
the end of each grant year (see attached "Financial Requirements" for speciﬁc details). We suggest that
you personally keep an accurate record of expenditures and commitments. Please note that year—end deﬁcits
cannot be recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Moreover, our failure to
receive timely annual ﬁnancial statements from your grants ofﬁce will stop further grant payments.
Appropriate forms will be sent to your ﬁnancial officer at the end of the grant year. Administrative problems
are relatively rare and we hope that this statement of our ﬁscal procedures will obviate any possible

misunderstandings.

SUBJECT: MODIFICATION TO ADD A FAS UNIT TO A PROTOS 80 MAKER
MAKING AND PACKING DEPT, BUILDING 601-1, WHITAKER PARK
FTC/PTO #00424R8

Dear Mr. Abrams:

Thank you for advising the Department of your plans to add a FAS unit to one of the makers
which allows the addition of natural menthol, at the maker, instead of the standard process of
adding menthol to tobacco product in the top dressing drums in the Casing and Cutting
Department at Tobaccoville.

As presented in your August 5, 1997 letter, the Department approves the installation and
operation of a FAS unit at Building 601-], Whitaker Park. RJRT may proceed with the
installation and operation of the FAS unit as permitting is not triggered by this modiﬁcation.

For this modiﬁcation, the Department accepts the assumption VOC emissions by direct
application of natural menthol at a maker will not signiﬁcantly affect the current emission factor
used for this process. However, in the future, should additional FAS units be planned, including
menthol application to other brands, we would request certiﬁcation of VOC emissions by use of
appropriate data which may include emissions stack testing. This certiﬁcation would then be
used to validate the assumption of no increase to VOC emissions by addition of natural menthol

(F AS unit) at a maker in lieu of processing Tobaccoville Casing and Cutting mentholated
product.

Dear John:

It appears to be universal practice for cigarette companies w

I am enclosing several advertisements taken from current Spanish
publications such as El Diario, ABC de las Americas, and Temas.
In addition, I saw a lighted display sign in a subway station
advertising Kent cigarettes in Spanies, with the warning in tiny
English letters.

Six cigarette companies are covered by the consent orders
Phillip Morris Inc., Docket No. C—2181; American Brands, Inc.,

Docket No. C—2182; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Docket
NO. C-2183; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, DOCket No. 0-2184; and,
Digget & Myers Incorporated, DOCket NO. C-2185).

. They will certainly argue that their conduct is in
precise compliance with the letter of the agreement, which specifies
the exact wording of the health warning. The companies_agreed to:

statement prescribed in Section 4 of the

Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to enclose
our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the
last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses
several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific ‘
instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by .
members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists

who SCI‘VC as 0111' peer {CVICW committee.

Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit
institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two
or three years) in ‘a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an
award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding
is based on your progress and the materials yOu submit with the renewal request forms.

The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the
Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. Complete scientific
freedom is assured and our only expectation is publication of research results in

Three RSM type tests have been conducted on Full Flavor Non—Menthol
products to date:
1. Original RSM Test (1976) — A feasibility test incorporating six
key product variables and 27 test products to test the RSM
methodology for application to our product testing (5 additional
products were used to validate the results).

2. FF Non—Menthol Screening Test (1977) — A test incorporating 16
product variables and 20 test products to determine the relative
importance of the product variables in terms of their effects

on consumer product acceptability.

3. Improved WINSTON King RSM Test (1978) - A 45 blend RSM test incor—
porating seven key product variables and ranges determined from
the previous screening and RSM work designed to test against
Marketing action standards for an improved product.

All of the test products were tested on a paired basis through NFO
among WINSTON, Marlboro, and Other NFF smokers. WINSTON King was used
as the control product throughout in the 1976 and 1977 studies. In
the current 1978 study, WINSTON King was the control product among
WINSTON smokers and Marlboro was the control among Marlboro and Other

NFF smokers.

The results of these studies have been used to develop RSM models
which include the effects of the seven key product variables on
consumer product acceptability, tar level, nicotine level, and other
laboratory measured variables. Approximately 85% of the variation
in consumer preference is explained by the RSM model, indicating a
good "fit" to the data.

\

In addition to having actual results of 97 product variations tested
over a wide range, the RSM model can be used to "simulate" any number

of products over the entire range of the variables studied in order

to determine areas of product types which would meet the Marketing
action standards. Over a half million products were simulated using

the RSM model. The results indicate that less than 1% of these products
would meet the action standards and, of those, about 90% fall into four
narrow ranges of the variables tested. Table I, attached, lists the
entire range of each variable tested along with the four areas of
"potential" products which would meet action standards.

The manuscript has been approved by all of the authors.

Our manuscript describes a series of studies which evaluated the
rather than burns tobacco which was developed by R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company. The significant findings reported were large
reductions in the yields of many chemicals from the new cigarette
and that these reductions were associated with a reduction in
Benowitz that appeared in the June 15, 1989 issue of the Journal
called for a "worldwide attempt to reduce the yields of toxic
substances and to make the yield of all cigarettes as low as
possible." Our studies demonstrate that a cigarette that heats

rather than burns tobacco can achieve substantial reductions in
the yields of many compounds.

The manuscript has been reviewed by Dr. Peter Dews from Harvard
Cline from the UCLA School of Medicine. All three reviewers felt
that the studies described in this manuscript would be of great
interest to the vast majority of medical professionals. They
wholeheartedly recommended that we submit the paper to the New
England Journal of Medicine.

Dear Bill:

The perspective (and follow-up) afforded by a week seems
sufficient for reporting, though not finally, on the results of
our effort last Tuesday at the National Press Club and the
announcement of “Helping Youth Decide.“
The event was, as you know, preceded by a week- -long period of .;
'background briefings' with key media. The coverage based uponE;-'
these briefings, the event itself and follow-up fall into two 3 ’
broad categories. These are Print and Electronic.

 
 

0n the print side, we have verified the following:

The reporter was Tom Squitieri.

Gannett News Service -- serving 86 newspapers in 37 states --
ran the piece. The reporter was Pat Ordovensky.
Scripps-Howard -- serving over 60 newspapers out of the
Washington bureau -— filed the story. Ken Eskey is the
reporter. A copy of this one has already been forwarded to your

USA Today ran with the story on the day of the event. As you
know from my backtracking, the eventual three-line item which
appeared in the National News section that day was culled from a
larger, more comprehensive piece done for the Life section by
lifestyle news by the Life section editors and it was shipped to
National where it was snipped by Julia Wallace who is a national
news editor. No follow-up by USA Today is planned, although
Life editor Linda Kauss wants to see updates on program
acceptance, usage, etc.

Dear Ms. Gustafson:

I am writing to follow up on my letters of December 7, 1994 and January 6,
1995. I hope that you still are interested in exploring the possibility of a cooperative
effort to reduce underage smoking in Washington State through the application of a

combination of our RIGHT DECISIONS/RIGHT NOW and SUPPORT THE LAW
programs.

Further, during our December 5th meeting we discussed the JOE CAMEL
advertising for our CAMEL brand. You were not surprised when I indicated that,
at that time, we were not prepared to discontinue all use of our present campaign;
however I take this opportunity to reafﬁrm what I did tell you during that meeting.
Even though we are confident that CAMEL advertising does not cause anyone to
begin smoking, if you believe that there are speciﬁc actions which we could take in
order to have a real impact on underage smoking, we are prepared to discuss your
suggestions in good faith.

I look forward to hearing from you on either or both of these subjects.

(a) A gap exists in brands on the market because no cigarette has both ' -- .

Dear Harmon

I enclose the competitive renewal application for our grant entitled “The
pharmacogenetics of lung cancer”. The following points may be of
assistance to the reviewers:

(i) The Progress Report shows that the recruitment of patients in Los
Angeles is almost complete. If we have finished the CYP2D6
genotyping assays prior to the next SAB meeting, I shall
communicate the outcome to you by letter.

(ii) Dr Daly and I have established the Newcastle group. with your
support. in a leading position in the new and emergent ﬁeld of
molecular epidemiology. As such, I have been invited to speak on
this work at the U.S.-Japan cancer meeting in Hawaii in February,
the Japan cancer meeting in Sapporo in July, together with three
other international meetings in 1994 in Toronto, Istanbul and North
Carolina. Clearly we wish to maintain our leading and inﬂuential
position in the field and thus renewal of our CTR grant. which is
central to our activities. is a matter of high priority for us.

[iii] We have been able to trim our expected budget to around the
$80,000 p.a. level because of the fall in the value of Sterling.

With kind regards.

Yours sincerely

there's no mention of the wine (or other) drink-

Dear Dr. Hockett:

Thank you very much for the privilege of reading this manuscript. 1
return it to you herewith and also enclose a copy of a recent article that has
some interesting and apparently contradictory findings, namely that the VST
returns to normal within a short time after experimental ligation of a coronary
artery.

I am still very much disturbed with the clinical implication of
this manuscript. As I wrote previously, the audience and the reader is con-
ditioned to accept the results without recognizing that the experiments
possibly lack clinical relevance. Thus.
(1) The authors point out that the Framingham study found that sudden
death from coronary artery disease was four times as high in the heavy smoker as
is the non~smoker. The authors also point out that the9 nost likely cause for
sudden death is ventricular fibrillation.

Hhat the authors fail to state is that neither the Framingham group
nor any other group found that sudden death from coronary artery disease occurs
predominantly while smoking or sooner after smoking. If this were so, there would
be little difficulty in proving cause and effect. On the contrary, the temporal
relation between smoking and sudden death has never been documented. Indeed all
evidence, at least within the hospital and within the Coronary Care Unit, indi-
cates that ventricular fibrillation with or without sudden death occurs without
immediate antecedent smoking. The experimental temporal relation therefore has
no counter part in clinical medicine. I do believe that these points should be
discussed and stressed in this article.‘

Dear Jack:

Thanks for your very prompt response to ny recent letter, and for extending

the deadline for my research grant until January 31, 1979. This will give us
time tom complete the research thatis already in progress and to develop a

comprehensive final report.

I am enclosing a copy of a recent letter from Ray Rosenman_in which he has
proposed a new and exciting additional analysis of data he collected some
years ago. A carbon of my response to Ray is also enclosed for your files.
The fact that Ray has becomre more deeply interested in the role of anger in
heart disease, and that we are able to assist and guide him in the analysis

of previously unevaluated data from the WCGS prospective study is most
gratifying. Hopefully, Ray will invite me to collaborate with him in a joint
paper and this raises the question of how-we should acknowledge support for
study was supported in part by a grant from R. J. Reynolds Industries, Inc."

Since.Ed Jacob has sensitized me to legal issues that I do not fully under-
stand, I am sending him a carbon of this letter, along with the correspondence

with Rosenmaa, so that we can obtain two expert legal opinions!

I have just returned from a very productive three week trip to the Middle
East where I attended conferenCes on stress and adaptation in Israel, and
consulted with colleagues in Greece and Turkey. Hans Eysenck and Ed Jacob

will be visiting Tampa next wehk to begin research on a new project entitled .

these developments with you in future correspondence or in a subsequent visit
to Winston-Salem. I appreciate your suggesting that Dr. Colby send me a copy
of his translations of excerpts of a recent German book on stress and heart
to meeting him on a future consultation visit to Winston-Salem. -

SUTTON SMOKING MAJERIAL

In August l967. personnel from the Sutton Research Corporation. Santa
Monica. California displayed four sets of cigarettes to COMPANY personnel.
One of these sets (70-mm. filler rod. no filter-tip) contained a non-
tobacco filler. the socalled Sutton material. The other three sets
(70-nnn filler rod plus 20-mm. Estron filter tip) contained l:3 tobacco
blend:Sutton material. 3:l tobacco blend:$utton material. and the tobacco

blend alone.
" A Sutton material cigarette on smoking burned much like a tobacco

cigarette. gave an ash which behaved and looked much like tobacco cigarette
ash. and produced smoke which had a very bland taste. This bland taste

persisted even when the cigarette was smoked to a relatively short butt
Analysis'of the Sutton material cigarette smoke indicated that it was
as low as or lower than tobacco smoke in respect of the concentrations of
those components considered harmful to the smoker by some authorities. The
components of interest include nitrogen oxides. hydrogen cyanide. acetalde-
hyde, acetone. acrolein, phenol. carbon monoxide. and certain polycyclic ::
hydrocarbons. Bespite the fact that these analytical data were derived from J

a number of cigarettes much smaller than usual. the results were encouraging.

Sutton Research Corporation on December 6. 1967, Mr. T. S. Briskin, President

Letter to the Editor of Personnel Administrator

 

 
To the Editor:

As the owner of a company with about 100 employees, I found
Lewis Solmon‘s recent article, "The other side of the smoking
worker controversy," interesting. I'd like to share my own

views, since I've had some experience with the issue.

A small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to
either ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers.
When they first approached me I considered the situation but,

for several reasons, decided against any restrictions.

First, implementing smoking policies would have required .
that I take action against good employees who have worked

for me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking
policy would have disrupted my company's work process, since,
as in many offices, employees with similar skills and responsi-

bilities work together.

Furthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis-
covered that the vast majority of my employees were neither

aware of nor particularly interested in the problem.
I have not read any of Weis' articles to which Solmon referred
nor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on
which Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggests
that rearranging people, changing policies, implementing rc-

strictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me meney.

Sincerely,

The materials we discussed in our meeting 1/16/86 have been received.
The information on the flavor loading in the LDPE is as follows:

0 IFF - no percentage of flavor was given. They suggested

running a 52 and 102 by weight of the flavored LDPE

Because all samples have different flavor loading levels, we will have

to use our best judgment for acquiring similar flavor levels on the

THE EPA HAS ACTED — NOW IT’S YOUR TURN]

Dear Friends,

The just— released EPA Report is an important new weapon
in the war to protect nonsmokers’ rights. As many have request—
ed, we’ ve made it available in a form you can use wherever you:

I Work

I Eat out
I

I

Have your hair cut, your car repaired, or
Visit an office or other workplace.

The EPA Report concludes that secondhand tobacco smoke
is a "Group A carcinogen" like asbestos, and that it causes
serious health problems for millions of children every year.

ASH worked hard to protect the report from tobacco-
industry sabotage. We succeeded: the interrogations of EPA staff

by the tobacco industry ceased, and the secret EPA compendium on
the dangers was made available to the public.

Now, like you, we want to be sure that we make the most
of this dynamite report. THAT’S WHY WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

ASH will be using the EPA Report to help persuade
legislators to ban — not just restrict — smoking in public

places. Some already have, but WE NEED YOUR HELP IN REACHING.
MORE OF THEM.

ASH is also informing businesses — including fast—food
restaurants, airlines, and others — about the EPA report. But

often its conclusions must be brought to their attention person-
ally before they will act. This is especially true of small and
local businesses. MT'S ONE REASON WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW!

So ASH has taken the major findings of the report and
added legal threats and additional arguments for businesses to

ban smoking. Then we combined them all in a brochure for OUR
SUPPORTERS TO MAIL, POST, AND — MOST IMPORTANTLY — HAND OUT!

We know that even this brief brochure can be very

effective, but only if it is placed in the hands of dec.ision-
makers across the country. THAT’S WHERE YOU COME IN!

The Arizona, Montana, South Dakota, and Utah legislatures rejected

states this year, eight of which would affect workplace smoking.
In addition to the four states rejecting measures this week,
smoking restriction bills were previously defeated in Idaho and
Mississippi; no state has enacted restrictions thus far in 1991.
Defeating smoking limitations ranks immediately after opposition
to cigarette excise taxes on RJRT’s and the industry's state
legislative priority list.

Dear Joachim:

I am writing to conﬁrm our willingness to provide you with genomic DNA ﬂanking the 5'-end
of the rabbit surfactant protein-A (SP—A) gene for your proposed studies to target Cre
recombinase to pulmonary epithelial cells. As you know, the SP—A gene is expressed in a
lung-speciﬁc manner; SP-A mRNA transcripts are detected primarily in type II pneumonocytes
and to a lesser extent in nonciliated bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara) cells. We have found

In consideration of the cell-speciﬁc nature of SP-A promoter activity, this genomic construct

should be most useful in targeting Cre recombinase to the same cell types in the lung that also
express gp330.

recombinanse—mediated gene targeting for creating cell—speciﬁc inactivation of gp330 will yield
important information regarding the role of this protein in lung cell biology.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: LNA Consumer Tests DATE: April 21, 1989
TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: J. P. Dickerson

I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project LNA-lOP,
scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailout. The LNA-lOV product, which is being mailed
for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining
consumer test data on a "no-nicotine" protocept. The LNA-lOV product has a
blend nicotine of 0.11% and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette.
Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05—0.06% in Merit Free

and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.05 mg/cigarette as compared to
0.06 in Merit Free and Next.

The low nicotine in LNA-lOV was obtained through conventional
denicotinization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the LNA-lOP
product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In

theory, the LNA—lOP approach will give approximately the same nicotine value
as the LNA-lOV approach, using tobacco blends in inventory.

If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing
the water extraction process with conventional denicotinization. Comparison

of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water
extraction is being changed significantly.
Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process
Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that

would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to
producing material for one consumer test.

I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we
have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the
materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we

As per your suggestion yesterday, I am sending you this note to
inform you of my intent to resubmit my proposal entitled, "Splenic
you provided. While my proposal did not achieve a fundable priority
score, the reviewers were nonetheless very enthusiastic about the
project. I know I can improve it substantially by November.

Thank you for your assistance.

Alternate Puffing Methods: Pentane Batch Processor

Purpose: '

To compare tobacco that was not puffed, tobacco processed through
the continuous FC~11 system, tobacco processed through the pentane batch

the 6—13 pentane batch processor.

1

Summary:

G-13A from the same lot was processed through the continuous FC-ll
system at No. 601, through the pentane batch processor, and the pentane
porous belt. Cigarettes were made using tobacco from each process and

unpuffed G-lBA, and using the WINSTON LIGHT 84 blend containing the four
G~13A types as replacement for regular G~13A.

The cigarette weight reduction using the FC-ll processed tobacco was
greater than either pentane method, using 100 percent G—13A (44 vs. 38%).
Weight reduction of the tobacco rods using the blend was 7.4 percent for
FC~11, 6.1 percent for batch, and 7.6 percent for the belt processed G~13A.
Draft was much higher for the FC~11 processed G-lBA’than for the pentane

processed tobacco. Chemical analyses showed higher nicotine loss and lower
sugar loss for the belt method than the FC~11 or batch. TPM, "Tar", and
nicotine in the smoke was lower for the FC~ll process than either pentane
method. Essential oils analyses indicated that the pentane batch process
was less severe, the FC—ll process was intermediate, and the pentane belt

process was most severe. Smoking panel evaluation did not reveal superiority
The pentane batch processor requires two hours cycle time and pressures
approaching 90 psia to produce tobacco puffed,about equivalent to that
produced in the FC«11 continuous process.‘ The pentane batch puffing system
is technically feasible; the liquid jet evacuation system does not appear to
be. The system would be labor intensive and present safety hazards.
Recommendations:

 

If pentane investigations continue:

1. Study the feasibility of a continuous belt system with remote control.

BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM


0 Several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third
quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies

CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM

o'FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models

Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute
ratings on NFC testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have

been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for
the following smoker groups testing RJR products:

FF competitive smokers

FF franchise smokers
FFLT competitive smokers

FFLT franchise smokers

0000
The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is
based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational
terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented

at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.

0 FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models

 

Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200

additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted
to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been

completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.

0 Consumer Test Data Base

Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on
292 CT tests has been catalogued.

0 Review of Competitive Brand Test Results

Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been
received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into
effect as of September, 1984.

SUBJECT: MARC INBOUND 800# COST REDUCTION IMPACT

MARC’s toll-free cost reduction will impact two of our operational areas:
Smoker Recruitment and Product Research. Savings in the 1991 Product Research
represents an 8% reduction in their total fieldwork costs. For the smoker
recruitment area, the savings are negligible as MARC’s new rate is slightly
lower than what we were paying in 1991; and the use of the toll-free operation

has been increased significantly with changes in our recruitment document
design.


reducing the cost we were paying for the diary panel recruitment tag-on. This
below.

- $46m was spent with TRACKER in ’91 for diary panel recruitment.
On a cost/complete basis, this cost was more than what we paid

MARC for smoker recruiting through SRMS. When questioned about
this discrepancy, MARC attributed this cost difference to the

different markups each group in MARC used. MARC has standardized
this markup, and the price was reduced to $23m.

- Instead of reducing the cost of Tracker by $23m, we asked TRACKER
to use this money to recruit as many smokers as possible due to
the low cost/complete with the new price. This has resulted in
doubling the number of smokers recruited.

. We also made a procedural change in how these smokers are used.
Instead of putting these smokers directly into the diary panel,
the smokers will now be placed in the SRMS and allocated where
they can provide the greatest benefit. For example, an 18-24 year
old Marlboro smoker to a CAMEL product test. This will allow us

to maximize savings for the company ($235m estimated in 1992)
through the most efficient allocation of resources.

If you have any further questions, please call.

Blind Product Test

T0: W. M. Hildebolt ' FROM: M. F. Dube

The results of a blind product test of fresh aftertaste (FAT) products
were reported on 11/5/87. The management summary provided by MDD is
controlled release pellet technology with a low level of menthol. These
products had measured smoke menthol deliveries of less than 6.5 ug/puff as
compared to approx. 70 ug/puff for Salem Lt. and approx. 45 ug/puff for
Newport. Three low menthol level products were tested, in which pellets
containing 3%, 5% and 7% menthol by weight were inserted in the filter.
No menthol was added via conventional means (i.e. top dressing, filter
flavor). Products were tested among 18 - 49 year old non-menthol Full
Flavor and Full Flavor Low Tar smokers, male and female.

In the FF category, all three products were rated inferior on %70+
acceptance. All three products increased menthol, minty and artificial
taste attributes. As we've seen repeatedly in qualitative work, FF
Further corroboration is provided by an earlier 1987 Concept/Product Test
rejected.

In the FFLT category, the 5% menthol product was rated parity among total
category and superior among 18 - 24 year old smokers and among smokers
with a high fresh aftertaste ideal. The 3% and 7% menthol products were
rated inferior to the Control among FFLT products with the 3% level
apparently too low and the 7% level too high. For the 5% product, tobacco
taste, strength and harshness attributes were maintained while fresh
aftertaste and cooling aftertaste were increased. Increases in mildness,
menthol, minty and artificial taste were also noticed; however, this
category did not view these attributes negatively as evidenced by the
positive acceptance scores.

These test results are highly encouraging in view of the fact that the
suspected target category for a new product with fresh aftertaste is FFLT,
young adult female smokers. Additionally, the 5% menthol pellet product
was parity among category indicating that its performance was comparable
to existing brands. However, it did have the aftertaste improvement
vehicle which should enhance acceptance in the FFLT category. We expect
to have a product with this technology on the market within the next 12
months.

Dear Senator Magnnson:


Officers and the representative of that Association on the National Interagency
v Council on Smoking and Health, I have been designated by our Association to
write to you to express the opinion of our Association concerning S. 559 and

labeling and advertising and are before your Committee on Commerce for-
consideration.

At its 1964 annual meeting our Association, cornposecl of the health
officer of each state and each territory of the United States, passed a recom—
mendation to the effect that since cigarette smoking is a proven health hazard
the state health departments and the United States Public Health Service'need to
develop comprehensiye programs to help to bring under control the habit 'of

f In View of the fact that our members unanimously agreed that scientific
"evidence shows that cigarettes are in truth a health hazard, we would like to been
record as supporting the type of federal legislation embodied in S. 559 or S. 547.
We feel that the major health hazards for which cigarette smoking is a causative
factor, such as cancer ofthe' lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, are so
important todaythat people .who smoke cigarettes, should be able to read on the -

labeling on the cigarette package the dangers to their health they are facing by
continual cigarette smoking. , ' A

‘We also feel that the Federal Trade Commission needs to have its
position clearly understood and strengthened as far as labeling and advertising


or simply leaves the Federal Trade Commission free to propose and undertake

such advertising control as it'wishes under its existing authority is a matter about '

which we do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable to cmnuwnl‘ at this time; except

ANALYTICAL SERVICE TECHNOLOGY
_____._.___.___________.______

During the third quarter, a number of modifications and improvements were
made. Among these were:

New Carbonyls In Smdke Method (Ayers)

The new method developed by Analytical Methods has been put into routine
service. Two operators have been trained to perform the analyses. No
significant problems have been encountered and data have been provided for
a number of studies. Demand for these analyses has been moderate and is
expected to continue at about the same rate.

Low Level Menthol In Smoke (Summers)

Optimization of the current method for the determination of the menthol
content of cigarette smoke has expanded the working range to include a
lower detection limit. The interest in this lower level of detection has
has been the result of interest in cigarettes with menthol contents less
than 0.05%, as compared with normal levels of 0.40 to 1.25%. Analyses of
smoke from cigarettes with menthol contents of O, .07, .11, and .27 mg/cig
gave deliveries of O, .01, .02, and .04 mg/cig respectively. Tests are in
progress by the Sensory Unit to determine the least detectable level by
the smoking panelists. More tests may be requested, pending the results
of these tests.

Modification of the liquid chromatographic method for the determination of
licorice content of tobacco products has provided the capability to
simultaneously determine the content of wintergreen in wet snuff as well.
This eliminates a second sample preparation by distillation and both can
be quantitated from the same LC chromatogram. Also, since sample
preparation only requires an extraction, this procedure could be used on
site to monitor the production of wet snuff. Comparison of data from the
established GC method and the new LC method to determine the accuracy and
recovery has been completed, and the precision study is underway. All

DRAFT LETTER TO RJRT OFFICERS

Date

Name
Address

Dear

I am sure you recognize the extent to which our future success depends
on decisions made by elected officials in Washington and the state capitals.
Anti—tobacco groups are intensifying their efforts to achieve a "smoke-free
society,“ and supporters of our industry in Congress and the state legis-
latures are finding it more difficult and politically costly to take a stand
on our behalf.

dramatically increase its involvement in the political process. We must
continually ask elected officials for their support, and it is vital that we
be in a position to support them in return. As you know, the RJR Political
Action Committee is the best means available for our company to financially
support candidates who will consider our views intelligently and fairly.
However, for a variety of reasons, current PAC receipts are inadequate to

meet our increasing needs.

 

The RJR PAC deserves your most serious consideration and attention. Parti-
cipation in the PAC is voluntary, and no rewards or penalties are involved,
but any officer who is unwilling to make an investment in R. J. Reynolds
the challenges we face in the political process.

Enclosed is a membership form and a return envelope for the RJR PAC. The

suggested contribution rate for the RJR PAC is .6% —- recognizing that
officers are also asked to contribute .4% to The Tobacco Institute PAC for a

total of 1% gross salary. Payroll withholding is, of course, the preferred
method of participation in the RJR PAC. A contribution form for TIPAC will
be sent to you after the first of the year.

I am confident that all RJRT officers will join me in supporting the PAC.
If you are already contributing, but at less than the suggested rate, I

encOurage you to consider increasing your level of support.
Sincerely,

  

James H. Johnston

I read your recent letter to Dave Tott telling of your past association with
Art Yorozu. You also described your analytical model predicting levels
of contaminates in B727 aircraft cabins, and requested detailed
information on the B727 ventilation, air velocities and leakage rates.

We appreciate your need to improve the accuracy of your analytical model
limited amount of information that we may be able to provide you would
be of little use. All information on air velocities, ventilation rates and

l leakage rates for the B727 is for new production aircraft. These values
could change significantly as a function of interior configuration, aircraft
service life and maintenance history. The test data you mentioned,
obtained from measurements within aircraft cabins, is most likely your
best source of information today.

I'm sorry we cannot meet your needs. Please feel free to contact me at

Dear Dr. Gardner:

Following our discussion in New Haven, I reviewed my twin
populations born between 1897 and 1952. Our records show that there
were 7,859 pairs of like—sexed twins born in this period who sur-
vived to one year of age. Studies we have conducted in the past
would lead me to say that we should be able to locate approximately

in Connecticut. This certainly is more than the minimum number of
pairs we discussed.

I have requested permission to attend the meeting in Miami
Beach the week of December 10 and have made reservations for arriv—
ing on the 9th. I hope you will make reservations for me. I anti-
cipate approval of my request and hope to see you shortly.

Subject: Neipmann Qualification Testing

The following are results of requalification testing of the Neipmann Reclaim unit
Dept. 1-1 at #1 Cigarette.

Milli

A11 examined phase III cigarette parameters were within prescribed action limits

W )1

Cigarettes were collected from machine #5 using Neipmann processed tobacco and
compared with samples from machine #10 (without Neipmann reclaim) for spotting and
staining. After approximately four days ageing the control product (Hch.#lO)
contained 27 spots and the test (Mch.#5) 22 spots. Samples will be evaluated again
at 30 days and at 90 days.

W

Fifteen random samples of Neipmann processed cutfiller totaling 76.67 pounds were
collected for contamination testing and sieves. Rejects with filters containing 8%
plasticizer and three center glue lines were used during this sampling. Only one
piece of charcoal was found in the total 76.67 pounds sampled. This piece was an
entire charcoal plug and therefore would not pose a risk to finished cigarette
contamination. This one piece of charcoal compares with totals of 19 and 11 found
in similar size samples in prior testing of product without center line adhesive.

 
In addition to the charcoal there were over 7,600 pieces of paper found in these
same samples for an average of 101 pieces per pound. This count is approximately
19‘ higher than the average paper content in finished shorts. However, the
particle size of the paper is visibly smaller than paper found in shorts and
therefore is less objectionable.

Sieve analysis of these samples resulted in an average of 27.36; pass the 1k mesh.
(Attachment 2)
Samples have also been collected from product using 6‘ plasticizer and three center
are currently 38 pallets or 1140 cases of product with the standard 6% plasticizer
filters on quip at CDC. This product will be released by RJRTI R&D pending
favorable results from contamination tests. Henry Ebert will schedule a meeting
next week with necessary parties to review these results. If results are
favorable, RJRTI RED will approve use of the Neipmann for T1 brands.

Dear Dr. O'connor:

I have cut and pasted the most relevant abstracts from what was left i
of the search on ultrasonic extrusion after ordering several papers 1
which seemed most relevant. j

There was much redundancy; I have tried to select descriptive, represen-
tative abstracts that represent the whole.

extruder, drawing device, etc.) does have a measurable positive effect
upon a form(' operation. This effect may be: decreased friction (in-
creased die I fe); increased extrusibn speed; better surface appearance,
better uniformity; or combinations of these, taken so that the product
is better when ultrasound is used then when it is not persent.
l
1
I'm sure there are trade offs among these several effects, and I'm also 3
sure that the effect upon the quality and economics of forming the fuel '
source must be evaluated for the project at hand.
The attached four pages of abstracts will givethe reader a feeling
for this applied technology, most of which dates from the 1960's and 70's I
but originated in the late 50's.” 1

I hope this abstraction of abstracts is helpful.

RE: 95N-0253
(Regulations RESKﬁCting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless
Tobacco Products)

On behalf of Machinists Local (local number), I am writing to express our strong
opposition to the proposed regulation of tobacco products by the FDA,

The proposed regulations, taken in their entirety, will certainly lead to much more
severe controls on the use of tobacco products by adults. They go right at the economic
viability of the tobacco industry and in turn the livelihood of our members whose jobs
depend on the industry

What is most outrageous is that rarely in all of the cebate over tobacco regulation
is there ever a mention ofthe jobs of thousands of hard working men and women whose
livelihoods depend on the tobacco industry The excellent wages and beneﬁts we earn
enable us to provrde for our families. send our children to college, care for our parents.
grandparents and grandchildren.

Because of these wages and beneﬁts. we bolster the standard of living and quality
oflife in our community Tobacco industry workers will not be the only ones hurt by this
attack on the tobacco industry. The people who work in the businesses we patronize-the
restaurants. grocery stores, appliance shops, hairdressers and car dealers to name a haw--
Our union agrees that teen smoking is an important issue that should be addressed.
Bu! regulating away thousands of jobs is not the answer. States are already required by
federal law to pass legislation restricting access of tobacco products to minors Our uruon
and the industry support these eﬁ‘orts.

Tobacco is a legal product produced by American workers and should continue to
be treated as suCh. A percentage of American adults will choose to use tobacco products.

Dear Dr. Chisholm

Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of ' research support, I am pleased to
enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants. currently supported and a brochure describing
preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step,

potential applicants should submit a brief preliminary outline (3 to 4- pages total) of the study

for which supportis sought. It should contain the f allowing, information:

1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.

2. A brief outline of. plans and goals for the. proposed research, specifying the next steps tobe
taken-

3. Anticipated duration and. annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The
Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are. made f or.
one year at a time, up. to: two annual renewals can. be considered. on. the basis of progress.

It would. also be helpful to have:

1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional
level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.

2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely
related to the project for which funding is being sought. ‘

Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory
Board for scientific merit and for ”fit" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical
research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal
detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two
months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided.
Submission deadlines for £u_ll (not preliminary) applications are May.3l and November 30;
activationis typically seven months later.

Sincerely,

Since this award will conclude the three years originally programmed for the project, it is
considered terminal for the project and a comprehensive ﬁnal report is expected after completion
and reprints of any current or future papers resulting from research supported by the award must
be submitted.

Please review the enclosed "lmportant_Procedural Information for (-Iantees." Please ﬁll in
the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me. Contact Drs. George Hashim or
Donald Ford of our scientiﬁc staff on matters concerning your grant and keep us informed about

This will report on our meeting with Christ Whittle at which 13-30
presented an update and stewartship report in resnonse to my letter
of February 28.
Overall, 13—30 appears to be delivering the staffing and services
required by the contract or spelled out in the original 1981 proposal.
In those cases where there are exceptions, they seem to have a
reasonable explanation.
The following is a brief summary on each area covered:

Field Staffing

Internal and field staffing equals or exceeds that outlined in the
original proposal. While some of the internal and field staffing also
spend time on other 13—30 properties, it seems that overall the
original requirements are being met. _0ne significant change involves
the substitution of full-time service reps in place of part—time

service people.

 


 

Monitoring

Monitoring and restocking of books is maintained on a twice weekly
basis vs. the original plan to service weekly. Area managers now

 

 

A relationship, deal with problems, etc. A toll free phone service
is now available to theatre managers to identify problems and request

Circulation by Market

3 A sunmary of circulation by market is attached. We also have theatre
‘ detail by market available. This circulation has not changed
significantly over the past 2 years.

 

Market Analysis of Annual Reader Poll

Reader response polls, conducted via insert cards, were part of the
original plan. These have been executed to determine movie preference,
frequency of moviegoing, etc. We may also use this service to detenmine
demographics, brand preferences, etc. We can also use full run card

inserts on a cost basis for promotion purposes.

Dear Hans :

After talking to you I had Cleve Laird prepare an
application—type statement for a supplement to our current
contract between Bio-Research Institute,Inc.and CTR to enable
us to study respiratory sounds and certain other physiological'
parameters in smoke—exposed Syrian hamsters.Preliminary work
showed that this non-destructive approach promises to furnish
exposure.0nce the Comparison between in vivo sound tracings,
wilé have been made this will provide a new approach to the 1:
study of effects of smoke upon pulmonary function and health.

Unfortunately through an unbelievable mix—up in the mails
this material,mailed from Boston on August 15th reached me this
morning.No time remains now for cleaning it up and I am sending

I hope you can convince your colleagues on the CTR advi—
sory committee that this is a worthwhile effort and that we can
get the funds to purchase the equipment which we have currently
borrowed and improvised .

I am sending Bob Hockett copies of all of this so that he
is informed of our discussions.

with ,any thanks and best regards, ;f
P.S. I just learned that Dr.Lisanti visited us today and isL/jl1;04:;
informed on this.It is important that we get immediate actigady Hombu er

so that we can use for study the animals now being exposeu.

from England. Arrival is expected the week of January 22. Evaluation of
filters produced with the garniture will begin as soon as possible.

2) HY Tow

The SALEM KS product with HY tow selected for NFO testing was rejected
due to low firmness results. Another sample is being taken and will be NFO

3). Monsanto Filter

The equipment is being set up and sample filters will be made the week

of January 22 for RJRTI testing. Application to cigarettes in Brazil is
planned. ‘

4) WINSTON Lightsz SALEM Lightsl and CAMEL Lights Box Products

Prototypes with correct tar and nicotine values have been prepared. Repeat

tests to obtain enough.product for panel evaluations and more extensive physical
and chemical analyses are underway. The work is currently on schedule or
slightly ahead of schedule.

5) Multidrsft Unit

The instrument was moved to 97-1 and made operational for use in monitoring
VANTAGE 9 production. Initial results using air dilution percent measured by the
unit to predict tar and nicotine on production product were good. This has been
done more or less as a "shake-down" exercise. We will attempt to have the unit
available for the CAMEL Light 100 startup on January 29.,

I understand that the National Toxicology Program is accepting comments for use in its
consideration of a petition to list environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) as a “known human

In the meantime, as you may know, a federal district court recently vacated the 1992

review and consideration as the NTP considers listing ETS.

The opinion begins by discussing the procejdkillres Congress had established for EPA to follow in
its research program on indoor air quality. e court concluded that EPA fell short of complying
with those procedures. The court then, however, reviewed the record to determine whether,

RE: M2 CREATIVE FOCUS GROUPS

 

The following summarizes the findings from the M2 Creative
Focus Groups conducted in Dallas on August 25—28. A more
comprehensive report of findings is expected from the group


Research efforts to date have indicated that Virginia Slims
smokers are perceived to be most like the desired perceptions

of the M2 target (independent, self—confident, action—oriented).
The major deficit associated with Virginia Slims smokers is

the perception of not being warm/friendly. This deficiency
results in a number of M2 target women perceiving Virginia Slims

Initial creative efforts for M2 included a range of alternative

However, it was not known whether these executions projeCted
the independence, self— confidence, active orientation desired
by the target, while retaining the elements of warmth/friendli—

ness.

OBJECTIVES

In order to be retained for further consideration as an M2
following:

1. WOmen shown in the ads must be perceived as independent,
_self—confident, action—oriented individuals who are also
warm and friendly.

2. Executions must maintain some tie to the SALEM “High
Country" ads, but be seen as different enough to communi-

cate that M2 is a new branc.

GROUP COMPOSITION

Six group sessions were conducted among female smokers of 100mm
menthol brands. Two groups were comprised of Virginia Slims

MARLIN APRIL TOPLINE REPORT

The MARLIN Topline Report covering the April period was issued on May 30.

Performance Overview:

Industry Full Price/Savings mix held about ﬂat in April. Retail performance of most
companies was also stable month-to-month.

RJR’s Full Price performance was in line with expectations. We experienced continued slight
SOM and SOFP softness related to increased retail presence on Marlboro, continued high

levels of competitive Branded Savings discounting, and less aggressive discounting activity
than anticipated on our own key FP brands.

RIR’s Savings business stayed on trend from March to April, with slight growth on DORAL
partially offsetting continued softness on MONARCH and BEST VALUE.

Outlook:

We don’t expect to see any change in our FP performance in May. We have no national
workplan activities on CAMEL/SELECT for May and we’ll continue to be impacted by the
same competitive factors that contributed in April.
Our Savings business in total will also likely remain somewhat soft, but DORAL is expected
to gain share in May as retail support (BSGSF) increases.

Given the MARLIN audit schedule for the May period, retail data for May is expected to
show little, if any, impact from the PM product recall.

The Institute leases 22,412 s/f of ofﬁce space in Washington, DC. The base rental
for this space is $34 per s/f. Our lease expires on December 31, 2004. We have an
option to terminate the lease without penalty on May 31, 2001.
I have attached a lease buyout proposal for our Washington oﬂice space. This
proposal provides that we will be released from our lease obligations if we make a
lump sum settlement payment of $575,790 and continue our lease payments through
October 31, 1999. If our landlord ﬁnds a tenant who needs access to the space
before October 31, 1999, TI will vacate the space early and its rent obligation will be
reduced accordingly.


I recommend that The Institute’s member companies accept this offer.

I would like you to present this proposal to the T1 member company group that has
been dealing with Institute close-down issues.

Dear Ms. Lipic:

Thank you for your interest in The Tobacco
Institute's new youth initiatives. These initiatives
are designed to discourage young people from smoking
and to prevent their access to cigarettes. These steps
expand upon and reaffirm previous actions taken by the
industry to steer its product away from young people.

I'm happy to send you several copies of "Tobacco:
Helping Youth Say No," as you requested. The booklet
is designed to help adults help children resist peer
children about peer pressure, which is one of the
primary reasons children smoke. It can also be used by
educators, to help them in discussing the subject with

students.

The industry is committed to a long-term program
to discourage young people from smoking.

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Johnson:

Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. In response to

your request, I am pleased to enclose a copy of the explanatory materials sent by L
ﬂThe Council for Tobacco Research to potential principal investigators who have

inquired about support for their research projects. Those materials detail our two

step application process. The executive committee of our Scientific Advisory

Board first evaluates a Preliminary Application and decides whether or not to

encourage submission of a Full Application.

Their decision is based not only on scientific merit, but also on appropriateness for
inclusion in one of the Council’s multidisciplinary program areas, as well as
recognition of current support levels for similar projects. This procedure takes
about two months.

’ In order that your office has on hand a reference set of our Full Application
forms, a sample copy is enclosed. You "will also find in this package our Statement
of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over
the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,


Arthur D. Eisenberg

APPLIED R&D WEEKLY STATUS REPORT

0-7 Extract Blending ,

An alternate approach to 6-7 preparation which features
blending of extracts for application to a base sheet has looked
promising on initial tests. A second series of pilot line tests
of 6—7 extract blends is scheduled for March 18, 1985. Four ex-
perimental 6-? products from a previous test are to be incorpo-
rated into WINSTON KS products for consumer testing.‘ Scheduling
for this test is currently being arranged through the Full Flavor

Non-Menthol Matrix Team.

Increased Oriental Scrap in 6-?

Work is underway to utilize oriental scrap, which was pre-

viously added directly to blends, in 6-7. Tests have been ini—
tiated to determine the effect of added Oriental scrap on 6-?
smoking quality. Oriental scrap levels of MS. 61, and 81 of 6-7
blend will be tested on the raw materials panel. SED discrimina-
tion panel testing of four major brands containing the test 6-7

will be performed.

Hercules Co-Extruded Polypropylene Film

Hercules has submitted a sample of a new co-extruded poly-
propylene film for evaluation. A test has been scheduled for the
week of March 13 to evaluate this film. The purpose is to
moisture loss study will be conducted using Norprop co-extruded

as the control.

PROJECT N0. 2354 — CHEWING TOBACCO

 

Saecharin Replacement

Factory tests designed to evaluate replacements for saccharin have been
completed and a report issued. Test results indicate that increasing licorice
from both quality and cost standpoints, should saccharin be banned. FDA has
not yet banned the use of saccharin in foods, but has reported finding bladder
tumors in some of the animals used in their feeding studies.

Licorice from Chemicals and Phosphates2 Ltd.

Tests designed to qualify a higher percentage of C&P licorice on Days Work ,
and to re—qualify it for other plug brands have been completed and a report
issued. Test results indicated that products made with C&P licorice were equal
to or better than controls. Manufacturing approved the recommendation that the
Plug Division be allowed to use C&P licorice for up to two-thirds of the licorice
requirements for-each plug brand.

Rishmac Licorice

Tests designed to evaluate and qualify spray dried licorice produced in Iran
by MacAndrews & Forbes on plug tobacco have been completed and a report issued.
Test results indicated that this licorice would be suitable for up to fifty per-
cent of the licorice requirements for chewing tobaccos. Usage of Rishmac licorice
at this percentage was recommended in the report and Manufacturing accepted the
recommendation.

PROJECT N0. 2356 — FIRMENICH/RJR BURLEY PROGRAM

 

Burley Flavor Modifiers

Preliminary evaluation of Burley Flavor Modifiers (Series l7, l8, and 19)
submitted to RJR in October, 1972 was completed in January and a report submitted

to Firmenich. Two flavors (RJR 17C and 198) were accepted for commercial evaluation

and Series 18 was rejected. .The date for acceptance or rejection of 17C and/or
compounds present in the Burley Tobacco Essential Oil which are in 17C and 19B.
Our top dressing tests to date indicate that 17C is the best of these two flavors.

INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

\‘\

To: Dr. G. R. DiMarco May 8, 1984
From: M. Stowe

Subject: R&D and PT&D Projects on Specially Processed
Tobaccos

Drs. Bernasek, Dickerson, and I have discussed the type of
R&D work which we feel shouldwbe conducted as an extention of
the MaD Project. We-recommend that work be undertaken in

R&D to I) confirm the effect of this type of tobacco
processing on smoking characteristics, and 2) determine
which process(es) RJR should develop. An outline of the
project work and staffing which we recommend for 1984 is
attached.

Since further evaluation of blendsidepends on the
availability of adequate quantities of the specially'
processed tobaccos, an attempt wasfmade in late April to
produce cast reconstituted sheet at TMCI, Inc. The sample
arrived in R&D on Monday. If the shoking characteristics of
this material are judged to be acceptable (or close enough to
lead us to believe acceptable material can be made at TMCI),
then the R&D program outlined on the attached document should
be feasible for 1984. If this is not the case, the timetable
will be lengthened considerably. '

Recommended staffing for the R&D pnoject is shown on the
project outline. The appropriate Managers have been
contacted to determine that temporary assignment of the staff
indicated to this project is possible if you approve this
commitment of R&D manpower. Because his time is heavily
committed to work on TGA, Dr. Casey is not included in the
project staffing. Dr. Dickerson had indicated that a
limited amount of his time would be available for
consultation, and I will ask Dr. Lloyd if such an
arrangement will still be possible.

A major objective for 'Pwo' in 1984 should be to establish
facilities for the production of experimental quantities of
upgrading of the 67 Pilot Plant will put us in a position to
conduct process research on either or both of these types of-
reconstituted sheet. Without such facilities, it will not
be possible to conduct research of @ny quality on the

type of treatments needed. A memorandum is attached which
outlines the work which.PT&D will conduct in support of this

project.

Subject: Technology Driven New Products Reporting Structure
 
Jerry:

Currently, the reporting structure for Project TSB consists
of multiple committees and task forces. At the bottom level is a
working team composed of representatives from various departments
who are charged with the responsibility of coordinating day-to-
day details of the project. This group reports to the TSB Task
Force currently chaired by Bob Lloyd. The Task Force, in turn,
reports to a Steering Committee composed of Hudnall Christopher,
Harry Lees, Dale Sisel, and me. This Steering Committee was
mittee has been formed to coordinate RJRT, RJRTI, and McCann-
Erickson efforts to introduce a brand based on TSB technology.
The current TSB structure is outlined on the first attachment.

A second project, TGA, is now beginning to develop a similar
too much of its,exists on TSB, and a similar phenomenon may be
expected with TGA. Attachment 2 outlines a plan to replace the
TSB structure and incorporate a reporting system for TGA and
other technologically driven new product projects as well.

Features of this plan are as follows:

Draft is the resistance to the flow of air. A standard flow rate is used
to measure the resistance which is recorded in either inches or milli-
'meters (mm) of water. The higher the resistance, the higher the number
of the measurement.


Firmness is a measure of the softness of a cigarette tobacco rod. The
measurement is made by applying a standard force for a standard peribd
of time to the tobacco rod and meaSuring the depression in 0.1 mm.
increments. Therefore, 0.1 mm. of depression is called 1.0 units of
firmness. The higher the firmness-number, the softer the cigaretteﬁ

Smoke Analyses are obtained by placing the cigarette in a special holder,
lighting the tobacco rod and pulling air-(35 ml) for two seconds once
per minute. This constitutes a "puff". The cigarette is puffed as
specified above until the fire cone or burning zone reaches a line 3 mm.

'Puff Count is the average number of puffs required for all of the cigarettes
in the analytical procedure to reach the specified 3 mm. distance from

p _the tipping paper.

Nicotine is the pharmacologically active alkaloid ingredient in tobacco
smoke, and is collected on a special filter during the smoking procedure.
The nicotine is reported separately from other smoke components.

Tar is all the solid and liquid materials in smoke except nicotine, which is
reported separately, and water, which is subtracted, to obtain weight of
tar per cigarette. ~-

value above 7 is basic. '

Implications of Measurements Upon Consumer Perception

Draft: Typical cigarette draft is about 2.4 to 4.5 inches. Too low a draft
would make it difficult for the smoker to pull air through the fire cone
_ and generate smoke. Too high a cigarette draft would make the smoker
have difficulty pulling the smoke through the rod, e. g. the Strickman

B d H'chlrd . . . .
égéémwj Several weeks ago we discussed the pOSSlblllty of

. . your school district using the materials produced by
nmmemmmmmmmmm the Family C.O.U.R.S.E. Consortium. I sent to you a

mannwmmMe copy of the booklet, "Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No"
and a videotape of the public service announcements

that would send a message to parents that you join in
the effort to eliminate youth smoking.

I wonder if you have had a chance to review these
materials that we are providing to school districts at
no cost. .Assuming that your schedule gets no lighter
after the first of the year, I have taken the liberty
to provide you with a form to facilitate your response.
Would you please take a moment to complete the form and
mail it to me at the address below or FAX it to

202/393-4385.

I do hope that you will join forces with the
Consortium to help parents and other adults communicate
with youngsters about a variety of issues like smoking
that are influenced in part by peer pressure.

My best wishes for a happy 1992.

Aluminum Metal Substrate

MEMO:

It was found that conventional substrate materials have a small pore
size on the order of a few hundred angstroms. These substrates; alumina.
bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to
(carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to
smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when
subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow
for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon
monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were
formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes
should result in decreased carbon monbxide and decomposition products.

Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021" diameter

wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8" wide x 60 mm
long.

60””


0,0. '075" '08{

Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at
a temperature near the boiling point. One of the rods weighed .1003 g

before dipping and .1820 g after dipping. Thus, .0817 g of glycerine was
deposited on the aluminum spiral rod. The other spiral rod weighed .1251

g before dipping and .2542 3 after. thus, .1291 g of glycerine was deposited
on the rod. \ xw i/IK/YI

New Marlboro 25‘s Date: July 11, 198”
Re: Mr. G. H. Long's Memorandum Dated 7/2/8ﬂ
Mr. B. V. Hardin From: D. L. Potter

The technical analysis of the new Marlboro 25's product and
packaging is complete with the exception of a thorough blend
analysis of Marlboro Light 25‘s, which will be completed on July 13,

1984. Attached are the results of our analysis with this one
exception.

We provide here a summary of the attached results for your review:

The blend analysis on Marlboro King Size 25's showed no significant
difference compared to Marlboro 20‘s product analyzed earlier this
year. No difference was found in the tow item, cigarette
circumference or percent air dilution. The difference in tip draft
samples tested and is not thought to be an intentional change.
The physical and analytical data collected for the Marlboro Light
20's and 25‘s products indicates there is no difference between
these two products. This cannot be confirmed until the blend
analysis is complete on July 13.

The major differences between the Marlboro 20's and 25's products
are in the packaging. Besides the obvious differences caused by
material differences were noted. The Marlboro 25's products utilize
a 45 lb. base paper in their foil inner liner versus the 28 lb.
liner found in the 20's pack, a 65 1b. C18 litho label in place of
55 1b. and .01" inch carton stock in place of .012 inch. Although
these upgraded packaging materials may offer some additional
packaging stability with rounder less sharp edges on the pack, they
may also cause an upcharge in the total packaging cost. This
upcharge includes the estimated savings resulting from reduced
material requirement. Preliminary packaging cost analysis indicates
a minimum 3% upcharge before purchased volume considerations are

taken into account which would significantly impact on the cost of
printed items.

The follow-up report will be issued as soon as the Marlboro Light
blend analyses are completed.

Dear George Hashim,

The graduate students in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental
Biology are hostinga symposium entitled: Pattern'and Polarity: Establishing
Difference in Development It will be held April 12—14, 1996. '1 This symposium will
explore the ways both'single celled organisms and multicellular organisms establish axes
and pattern for asymmetric cell division and embryonic development, and will include
discussion of organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, algae, nematodes, insects, and
vertebrates. This letter is written to request ﬁnancial assistance-for our graduate student

symposium.

This will be the sixteenth‘symposium organized by the graduate students in MCD
Biology. ' A unique feature of this event is that it is organized and run entirely by
graduate students from our department. These symposia allow us torinteract with
prominent scientists from diverse disciplines one—on—one, and introduce us to, deeper .
insights into many important queStions- facing biologists today. These symposia also '
serve to enliven'the scientiﬁc atmosphere of the region by bringing-prominent biologists
frOm around the world to Boulder,

In the past, the Graduate Student Symposium has been made possible by generous
researchers in the Boulder area, and from others interested inbiology. The total cost of , I
the symposium, the majority of which is used for transportation-and lodging of the v
speakers, is estimated at 15,000 dollars. Past contributions have-ranged from 500 to
the symposium and in the symposium program which is given to each attendee.

great deal of consideration to the proposal outlined
by you in your letter of November 7. 1978. to Dr.
Murry Senkus. As we indicated when you visited with
us in Winston-Salem, we feel your proposal is both
interesting and provocative. We have also shared it
with a few individuals outside the Company with whom
we consult regarding requests made to the Company for
research funds. We would like for one of them, Mr.
William S. Shinn of Kansas City. Missouri, to meet
Shinn is an attorney and is one of the people the
tobacco industry uses as liaison for research projects
presently onﬁoing. some of which may involve work
similar to t at suggested in your proposal. Mr. Shinn

We've had several questions about why we're looking for increased particle
size in stemming and there has been some work done to illustrate that larger


My position has been that we're looking for a cleaner product in pneumatic
separation to reduce stem particle "choke ups" in high speed machinery and
ally equates to product waste in the end. From this. if we achieve a higher
filling capacity with larger particle size, that's a bonus feature.

Anyway, this discussion with our Research people in Canada produced some
good discussions. 1 g

Dear David:

I enjoyed talking to you about our work at the ICEM meeting in Melbourne. I am convinced
and consequent birth defects and childhood cancer in offspring. Since smoking is a very efﬁcient way
to lower antioxidant levels. I expect that smoking will primarily damage sperm DNA through that
mechanism. Our review of the epidemiology appears to bear this out. I enclose our Pittsburgh paper,
where we make this case. We will continue this work to make the case as strong as we can. If
smoking is only working through lowering antioxidants then supplementation with antioxidants should
reverse all of the deleterious effects on the next generation. I think this is extremely important to know
and I am committed to ﬁnding it out ,

If you wish to collaborate with us by collecting sperm samples from smokers and non-smokers
in your company that would be very useful in speeding up the study as it is hard for us to ﬁnd smokers
locally. If you wish to add in a group of smokers of your presumptive safe cigarette to compare to
regular smokers and non—smokers. we would be agreeable to that. That might beneﬁt you and would
not be much extra work for us. If you are interested in this type of collaboration and would agree to
unimpeded publication of the results, however they came out, we would be enthusiastic about going
ahead. We would ﬁnance our end and you would do the same on your end. We believe that this is
work that will have a major impact on health and that it is extremely important to do as soon as
possible.
Your letter was quite convincing that the government is not subsidizing tobacco farmers.

Thank you for your letter of December 5, 1979 informing me of the
procedures for submitting a research grant application. I have
followed your advice and have outlined the research projects being in-
vestigated in my laboratory. I trust this information will be considered
by the Scientific Advisory Board, and I look forward to their decision.

Research Problem

I. Background — We are investigating the biological and biochemical
aspects of herpesvirus oncogenesis by employing three related equine
herpesviruses (EHV) which have proven to be ideal model systems as the
three viruses share DNA sequences but differ markedly in biological
activities (see review provided, O'Callaghan er al., 1978). In the last
year we have shown that UV-irradiated virus or standard virus preparations
enriched for defective interfering (DI) particles will transform primary
hamster (inbred LSH) embryo cells, and several cell lines transformed by
each of these herpesviruses have been established. We have demonstrated
that the EHV—l and EHV—2 (cytomegalovirus) cell lines are oncogenically
transformed and have established numerous tumor cell lines from the

tumor tissues (malignant fibrous sarcomas that metastasize to lung, heart,
bone, and CNS); the EHV—3 transformed cells have been inoculated into
hamsters within the last two weeks.

In the case of the EHV—l system, DNA hybridization analyses have shown
that cells of transformed cell lines, tumor tissues, and tumor cell lines
harbor viral DNA sequences (3—202 of the genome; 0.3-4.0 copies/cell).

Some of these viral genes are retained even after prolonged (+100 passages)
passage in either cell culture or in the animal (transplantable tumors),

and the expression of these viral DNA sequences has been shown by l) demon-
stration of antibody to EHV—l proteins in the sera of tumor bearing hamsters
and 2) detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins in the cell
membranes and perinuclear space by immunofluorescence. Presently, blot
hybridization analyses are being carried out in which individual restriction
endonuclease fragments (labeled to high specific activity by nick translation)
are being employed to identify and quantitate the specific EHV—l genomic

Re: WINSTON 100's "X", 16 mg Tar Unannounced Shipment Test

March 17, 1978

proposed timetable for unannounced shipment test of the WINSTON
100's 16 mg product.

Background

The WINSTON 100‘s Improved Product program was initiated in February,
preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that
female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred
Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. The primary reason for WINSTON's
lack of preference was its being perceived "too strong/harsh“ "less
smooth/mild" relative to Marlboro.

Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were
judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's. It was intended
that one of the products would be introduced into an "announced"

test market if it met the required action standards, which have since
been modified. The new "announcement" action standards specify:


.

(Additional element)
° Parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers.
(Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H)

' _Preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers.

for the 100mm NFF category.

' TPM at 17 mgs or less.

Test Results

Blend #2 demonstrated significant advantages over current WINSTON

100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards

for "announcement" test market. Test results indicated that blend
#2 was:

Dear Editorialist:

over the past few years, many state and local legislators
have been grappling with a new issue —- whether or not to
restrict smoking in many 'public' places.

The debate is often emotional. It revolves around issues
of health, management of private property, personal freedom
and law enforcement, to name a few.

The enclosed reprint, from our publication, LEGISLATIVE
POLICY, provides a thought-provoking perspective on the
subject.
I think you'll find it both informativ- interesting.

machine with data "corrected" mathematically to adjust for
mechanical distortions have shown improvement in machine per-
formance. Visual examination of puff shapes indicate that
good replication can be achieved. Goodness of fit of repli-
cated flow rate profiles to actual human profiles has
improved by 50% over the data obtained from the previous cor-
rection method. Replicated puff volumes and durations are
within 3 to 5% of desired values. The major step to be com-
pleted prior to beginning smoke regeneration work is the
installation of the mathematical correction procedure on the
HP-1000 computer system.

A two-liter syringe required for accurate calibration of the
Respitrace inhalation monitor was modified by the machine
spirometer. Modifications to software used to control the
inhalation monitor have been made which enable th syn-
chronization of data acquisition from both breaths (by means
of the Respitrace) and puffs (by means of the HP-1000 puff-
profiling system). Once modification of the puff-profile
software to provide for triggering of the Respitrace is com-
pleted, data from both breaths and puffs can be acquired
simultaneously.

current exciting project to examine the localization and regulation of neurotensin receptors
and their interactions with the dopamine receptors.

As you know, we have made significant progress in characterizing the behavioral and
physiological effects of antisense oligonucleotide administration to knock down each
dopamine receptor subtype. These rats will be made available to you, and should be useful
in examining the long—term effects of neurotensin on different dopamine receptors.
All best wishes and success in obtaining funding for your project.

You are listed there as being an American Cancer Society Professor

grateful for your using your American Cancer Society title in

Dear Dr. Herrera:

Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. I am
pleased to enclose a statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report
that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step
process. First, a short preliminary 'inguiry is sent to members of the Executive Committee of
our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for "fit" into The
Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review'
vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a [4111
application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual
renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.

The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminarv inguiries
year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated.
- Fall cycle - any inquiry received between April 1 and September 30 and encouraged by
the Executive Committee may be submitted as a Mapplication by November 30.

- Spring cycle - inquiries received between October 1 and March 31 and encouraged by
the Committee may be submitted as ﬂip applications by May 31:

anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate
of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three
page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature
citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the
proposal. they must be accomodated within the three page limitation.

2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal
professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page

Gentlemen:

Enclosed are three items I received recently bearing on smokers' rights and
proposed taxes and restrictions on the use of tobacco:

One is an article by Bruce Herschensohn published in HUMAN EVENTS newspaper
titled "Let Free Market Decide Smoking Rules," a concept I totally agree with,

as the free market has always proven to be far more effective than government
regulation.
Another enclosure is a mailing I received (as publisher of a national news-
of the regulation of tobacco use. Well written and full of useful information.

The final enclosure is a publication from Florida Tax Watch (a non—profit

proposed increase in the state tax on tobacco.

I hope you may be able to use some portion of these enclosures in your contin—
uing efforts to protect the rights of smokers in our supposedly free country.

Subject:_ Casey‘s General Stores

After many months of negotiations, we finally have a contract signed with Casey‘s. As
you know, back in April, Caseys’ decided to go with PM. and BAT; however, shortly
after that decision was implemented, they realized that to maintain their volume, they
needed us on contract as well.

The current backbar setup for cigarettes (see pictures attached) is 8‘ long and 8.4’ high.
P.M. has 4’ or 50% of the setup and is on a base contract at approximately $60. Per '
month. BAT has the top portion of the other4' section or 25%, and has maximized their
payment at $400 +. We have the lower half for the remaining 25%, and are on a full
PRP at our current grid rate of $140 per month. Our eight baskets, which is our prime
merchandising space, and encompasses the 3-P’s along with the Doral sign outside the
box starts at 30” from the floor and goes to 56” from the floor. Based on the average of
8‘ from the counter to the backbar, our space is all very visible.

The reason we decided to take the horizontal position we took was based on the fact
that over the last 4 years, Caseys’ volume has remained steady at about 135 cpw, and
thus has shown no upside potential. Based on this, we felt our merchandising space
was a good buy, and would more than adequately defend our business. Especially
when you consider what BAT is paying, and that we would have had to increase our
payment by at least $160 per month or $2,304,000 per year to share the top of the 4'
section with them. This just didn’t make good business sense.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence
that cigarettes containing nicotine fall clearly within
the definition of "drugs" which "are articles intended
to affect the function of the body of man." In addition,
the evidence against such cigarettes as a dangerous health
hazard, both to the smokers themselves and to non-smokers
far stronger, in fact, than any evidence yet revealed
against saccharin, which is already acknowledged to be
under your Jurisdiction and concerning which you have
already taken definitive action.

Your prompt regulation of cigarettes containing
nicotine can be a giant step toward saving untold numbers of
U.S. residents, now living and as yet unborn, from illness
and premature death due to lung cancer, heart disease
and other human ailments already linked to cigarette

smoking.

1. PUFFED TOBACCO
A. Tobacco Studies (Project 185: Fredrickson, Harper, llickman)

Study of the effect of sucker control agents on'the response of tobacco
to puffing processes is in progress. Composites of flue-cured tobacco from
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were used. The samples
were composites of the leaves from the upper two-thirds of the plant. Compo-
sites of burley from Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are
also being studied. The sucker control agents are two systemic agents, MH-30
and the potassium salt of maleic hydrazide, and four contact agents, l-octanol,
l—decanol, cocodimethylamine caprate, dimethyldodecylamine acetate (Penar).
pentane/wet steam. All flue-cured samples treated with sucker control agents
were more responsive to puffing than the hand-suckered tobacco. However, the
increases in the filling value for the treated flue—cured samples were similar.

more variable. No data are available for the burley sample at present.

The expansion of stalk composites of 15 commercial flue-cured varieties
grown at Oxford, North Carolina is in progress.

An exploratory study of the constituents involved in the thermo—plastic
deformation of tobacco during expansion has been initiated.

B. Smoke Studies (Project 180: Schumacher, Green)

Study of the particulate phase components of a control and wholly puffed
tobacco blend continues. Four of the 10 major chromatographic fractions from
the ether extract of each condensate have been investigated; study of a fifth
is well underway. Recent findings are shown on following page:

Dear Sir:

At the present time I am engaged in the Maytag Research Project
at the Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque. The research, which
is carried out under strict medical supervision, is designed to relate
some 110 events with pulmonary function data of unselected, healthy

yearly testing on these patients.

individuals with lung disease and/or cancer frequently differ from the
norm by the presence of an atypical protein moiety. The failure to
establish a. specific protein in every case is principally due, I be-
lieve, to the lack of refined technique; for it appears that patients
With bronchOSpastic syndrome have a definite biochemical predilection
to these conditions ; and this factor may well be a protein. If one
were able, through refinement of existing methods, to obtain statis-
tical evidence for the existence of such a diagnostic protein and dem-
onstrate that these individuals having it show abnormal findings in

alleged carcinogenic and irritative effects of tobacco may be purely
coincidental and not etiological.
Thinking a subject such as this would be of great interest to you,
I should like to apply to you for a grant to conduct a research program
to test my thesis. The best technique for such a project is starch-
gel-electmphoresis. The obvious advantage of this zonal method over
the free~boundary one is that the former affords easy isolation of the
protein substance, whereas this is impossible in the latter case. More-

over, of the two types of tonal analysis, the starch—gel method offers
better resolution than the paper technique. -- ‘

Inasmuch as the Maytag Project data are rapidly growing, and the
need for an additional program such as I have described is increasing,
a prompt reply would be appreciated. ‘

Thank you for ”your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Attention: Mr. Robert B. Walker-
‘Chairman of the Board
Gentlemen:
I doubt if this letter will get to the Chairman of the
Board, but anyway, I am a stockholder in the American Tobacco
Company and received your communication of October 25th, and I
frankly think the tobacco industry is hiding behind a log. As


tinue to do so, and of course, it is purely for their personal

, gain and not the public.

I have wondered why the tobacco industry has not asked
the Government why not label whiskey as dangerous to your health,
paregoric which can be bought at any drug fountain in small quan-
tities, and many other household items such as aspirin, etc. I
have wondered why the tobacco industry did not get the producers
association and different farm organizations busy on this, because

it is not going to end until someone makes it politica11y unprofit-;
able for the food and drug administration and Kennedys to make an
issue of it.

I have practiced law since 1933, have had a lot of deal-
ings with the medical profession, and how in the Hell they can say
that tobacco causes cancer, when they do not know what cancer is,
twenty years ago, when if a person had a bellyache he was automatic-
ally operated on for appendicitis, and that fed has blown over with
the medical profession. Also the tonsillectomy for all children
has blown over. I well remember when the medical profession sa
that Blue Cross would destroy the nation, and now they are the w
greatest believer in it, and it has enhanced their earnings. Also

0 On October 29, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment to the _
FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit-smoking

two years. This amendment was substituted for Senator Lautenberg’s_

proposal to ban smoking on flights of two hours or less for a period
of three years. Earlier this year, the House approved an amendment to
its version of the FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that

will be resolved. , '

vote of 206 to 205. The bill raises $12.8 billion in new revenues
without increasing excise taxes on cigarettes or denying deductions
for tobacco product advertising and promotion expenses. The Senate is
expected to consider its version of the reconciliation bill next week.
Simultaneous to this action in‘the House and Senate are the daily
meetings of the budget summit between the Administration and Congress.

Even if we survive in the House and Senate budget reconciliation bills
without a cigarette tax increase, we could still be vulnerable to an

excise tax hike if the budget summit recommends revenues above that in
the reconciliation bills.

There is no overlap between the goals of this grant and that

Heahyun Yoo to this aspect of the project is to achieve that

Dear Sir:

I wrote to different tobacco companies about my idea of
tobacco being connected with cancer. I am a full beleiver that
some type of vaccine--or shots is the cause of eancera This
vaccine is stronger than the disease you have and gets into your
veins, which immunes you to that particular disease. My theory
is that this vaccine lodges in your veins, after maybe a period
of years and causes a sore, which turns out to be cancer. It
happens in any part of your body.

We have people to die with cancer that has never smoked and
peOple to die with old age that did smoke, with out having

cancer.

Get a smear of the sore or cancer and test it with the
different vaccines.

Yours truly,

When looking ahead to the new Merchandising Contracts that will be resigned in all retail
accounts, we have an opportunity to “correct” the big on-going problem that we have
with out—of—stocks when the promoted product sells out (in a large percentage of our
stores),

Manager (along with the input ﬁom your AM ’s) should be prepared to explain to the group
your recommended Plan on how to utilize our new contract signing to solve the region’s
product availability problem as it relates to promoted product, retailers waiting for the
SR’s to place orders and the out-of—stocks that occur.

Can we use this contract resigning as “Leverage” to solve this problem?
Food for Thought:

I Is it time to change the region policy to ..... all promoted product
must be placed on temporﬂ displays and only non-promoted

product will be placed in our permanent displays?

D Can we as region truly implement 9 weeks of discount promotion

and then turn it off for 4 weeks ..... with non-promoted “Full”
displays?

D When we resign all accounts to our new contract can we require
that a certain number of required brands “MUST” be instock at all
times or deletion of payment will be made?

Cl How do we keep our priority brands in stock at all times?

which at this writing is still unresolved. However, we can

' Ngo n3°4-

Information is attached with regard to Evolutionary and

Revolutionary second generation programs. Both programs are
similar in that they target low/no CO and glass replacement as

key objectives. The Revolutionary program additionally seeks to
generation manufacturing concepts.

Abbreviated action plans are provided for each product concept.
Certain dates involving other departments were assumed based on
usual time frames. These dates are, therefore, subject to
approval and agreement.

As you will notice, there are a multitude of product concepts.
This number will probably expand even more before it begins to
focus on key opportunities. Decision dates are, therefore, built
into the plans, where possible.

The thing that becomes most obvious in reviewing the product
concepts is the need for (1) good and innovative consumer
research and (2) a sound and, perhaps, entrepreneurial business
perspective to realize the greatest possible profit potential

from the unique technology that we now possess. This technology
provides the opportunity of developing a wide variety of smoking

products where the profit potential is immense. It is critical
that this technology be married to an innovative consumer
research program that is capable of identifying market
opportunities for non-traditional smoking products.

Dear Mr. Dean:

program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company aimed at up—scale
adult audiences in Manhattan and Long Islands' finest hotels

and clubs.

be continued for 1988 and was concerned that perhaps it was
mistakenly included when programs which could be criticized
for possible exposure to teenagers were eliminated. There
have been recent competitive developments which lead me to
believe the competition is increasing their emphasis on New
York hotel sampling. And the painful truth is that should

we drop our affiliation with these hotels it may be impossible
to regain them should Reynolds' change its direction in the
future. This hotel sampling program would be an ideal vehicle
for the launch of the new smokeless cigarette we plan for 1988.

The best reason for keeping the program is the cost. This year
we will distribute 750,000 sample packs at a total cost of $153,900

or nineteen’cents a pack, not including the cost of product.
This successful promotion in the most coveted of marketplaces


Our major competitor in the hotel sampling program is Philip Morris
who has held this program on—line since 1970. We consistently run
into their samplers at a number of properties that we sample, as
Philip Morris has involvement with a number of affiliations here


versus the competition because we sample seven days a week.

Yesterday, for the first time, we encountered Lorillard at the
Sheraton—Center Hotel sampling "Newports" at the International

Hospitality Ball.

entitled ”Industry Inventory." I should think the Industry would
be defined broadly enough to garner several hundred thousand names.
Perhaps there needs to be a hard core of 600- 800 and, on top of
that, a contact group on which we have names and addresses number-
the statewide tobacco action network.

RE: Marlboro Media Plan

Attached is an excellent compilation of Marlboro's 1986 media plan and
key learning/conclusions relative to this formidable competitor's
media strategies/tactics. The information was compiled and analyzed
by Gabe Gabriel and is illustrated in a standard RJR plan deck format.
As Gabe concludes, Marlboro's media activity is extraordinarily broad
and extensive — a mass media schedule befitting a dominant—share brand
with appeal transcending focused demographic parameters.

lmportantly, it appears the media schedule is not designed to address
Marlboro's FUBYA strength but, rather, to maintain its ubiquitous

presence against total smokers, thereby defending its business against
smokers likely to switch out of the franchise.

This strategy is similar to RJR's in that neither Marlboro nor RJR
primarily concentrate efforts against franchise smokers. The key
difference is the direction in which the brands view their opportunity
segments. Marlboro's focus appears to be franchise maintenance as
their smokers grow older in age. Conversely, RJR's focus is against
younger adult smokers who may be brought into the franchise.

_BE_M____X~_M__.____ _~t .lP y

Marlboro Franchise -———-—-——~—€> Older Adult

Younger Adult~e—~—————€>RJR Brands Franchise

With your approval, next steps are to distribute Gabe's analysis to
the CAMEL, WINSTON and MAGNA Brand Groups, as well as Media Planning,
for their review and an enlightening look at the specific tactical
activity behind Marlboro's known high spending levels.
Let us know if you would like to discuss.

Committee - Meeting Minutes

To: Committee Members From: H..C. Threatt

The group previously calling itself the “Maximizing Acceptable Cigarettes
per Pound" Committee met February 29, 1984. Those attending were Hoyt Beard,
Jim Dickerson, Wayne Fulp, Bobby Hardin, Floyd Lockamy, Don Lamonds, John
meeting is attached (see Attachment 1).

I. Previou§_Meeting Minutes

There were no changes to the minutes of the last meeting.

11. Project_£i§£

The committee discussed the updated project list, a copy of which is
included with these minutes. Several good points were made for improving the
list:

Clarify ST (short term) and LT (long term)

Place the date on the list
Update in time to have a newly revised list for each meeting

Number the pages.

The group felt that several areas not presently involved should receive
copies of the list - Leaf Buying, Leaf Processing, and Facilities Development,
for example. Copying the Leaf and Blends Subcommittee members will be a big
help in getting proper distribution.

1. Corrections/changes need to be sent to Harold Threatt by March 14.

March 21.
3. Committee members should come prepared to address any errors at
March 28 meeting.
III. "Maker" Projects From Manufacturing Engineering

Don Lamonds attended the meeting for the first time. The committee felt
that it would be good to include projects in Manufacturing Engineering having
list. His projects are mainly quality related, but they fit the criterion
because of the reduction in the number of rejects, etc.

BRIGHT 85/100 Date: January H, 1983
19811 Flavor Development


The recent visit to Biddle Sawyer was very encouraging with regard to the
improved flavor components which were reviewed IOr the BRIGHT filter flavor

system. The deterpinated hearts of peppermint represent a giant step for-
ward in the fact that they will move us closer to a filter flavor system

which can be quantitatively/qualitatively monitored. Although we are at an
impasse at this time in being able to monitor the current filter flavor sys-
tem, it is imperative that we not lose sight of this objective in 1984. It
is requested that all filter flavor development work be directed toward
simplifying and reducing the number of flavor components added to the fil-
would be of the greatest interest in recognition of the current dilema of
not being able to monitor peppermint on our current products.

In addition to the present flavor improvement work which is currently under-
way, it is requested that the aforementioned approach be assigned a level of

importance and priority that is commensurate with any flavor improvement
work in 1984.

Please advise if there are any questions or concerns.

As we are postponing our Symphony meeting tomorrow, I wanted you to be aware of a
couple of issues that, in order to keep the ball rolling, we may want to address prior to

0 Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan.

I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to
Hogshead. HJ. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday.

As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. I. were going to propose
display, alongside Doral. They would not beneﬁt from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not

According to RP, I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond
another footprint.

At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the
idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and
switch it out with existing RJR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a
month instead of Dora], and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc.

0 That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having
full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead
with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do,
i.e. full partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock

We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart. I just wanted
you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation.

Dear Dr. Brady,

It was a pleasure to become acquainted with you at the recent

Some preliminary studies in my laboratory in Australia resulted

in the recent publication of a paper in Nature entitled " Nicotine, Smoking

and Cortical Inhibition ", a copy of which is enclosed. I hopefully suggest

that this paper may contain some of the most significant suggestions about the

psychotrOpic actions of nicotine to have been published and further pursuit

of these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of the psychotropic

actions of tobacco smoke. A comparison of the actions of ordinary and

"de-nicotinised" cigarette smoke on neurones in intact and isolated cortical

areas would constitute a logical extension of my preliminary experiments. I shall
‘ be moving to Winnipeg later this year to head a neuropharmacology research group,

and should like to pursue these studies as suggested above. At a later stage,



If you consider that a project along these lines entitled " A
Comparison of the actions of nicotine and tobacco smoke on single neurones in
»the central nervous system" would be of interest to the Council for Tobacco
Research, I should be happy to submit an application for support.

As mentioned during our recent conversation, I believe that this
technique of recording from single neurones with multiple barrel electrodes,
with which it is possible to stimulate or inhibit cells chemically, provides
a powerful tool for unraveling problems of this nature.

Re: Coupons and Sales Tax in South Carolina
Dear Ron:

I have discussed the above matter with Frank Skinner of our tax department,
who is knowledgeable in the area. He also believes that there is a problem with the
way South Carolina is approaching this matter and is willing to offer his help.
Please feel free to call him at (336) 741-0262.

I assume this was the subject of your call the other week; however, if it is
not, please give me a ring.

Best personal regards.

SUBJECT: KOOL MILDS 100: COMPETITIVE PRODUCT TEST RESULTS

The following provides results of Kool Milds 100's performance in the latest

SALEM Lights 100 competitive test. This competitive wave was to be the first
test of a nationally manufactured improved SALEM Lights 100 product against
its new action standard competitor, Kool Milds 100. However, the SALEM Lights
100 product picked up for this test was rejected due to low tar. Therefore,

only ratings for Kool Milds are available since past competitive waves tested
the previous SALEM Lights 100 product.
Results from Wave III, due in early November, will provide the next
opportunity to confirm the competitive status of the new SALEM Lights 100
product.

OVERALL ACCEPTANCE

Kool Milds 100's overall acceptance ratings are extremely low among both
competitive and franchise smokers.

OVERALL Z70+ RATINGS

ATTRIBUTE FINDINGS

Kool Milds 100 Versus the Ideal

Kool Milds 100 was significantly different from the ideal on all attributes
among both competitive and franchise smokers.

e Memorandum

Alternate Approaches to Low—Sidestream Cigarettes Date: December 21, 1982

Dr. D. H. Piehl
Mr. J. D.Phillips
to the development of low-sidestream cigarettes. I have prepared two
low-sidestream prototypes, one with information obtained by Dr. J. L. Harris
and the other with Earris' information combined with the use of "carbonized“
filler provided by Mr. J. White. Informal smoking suggests that these
prototypes do not exhibit the harsh, irritating mainstream taste and irritating
sidestream aroma which is common to the current OC-prototypea.

Dr. Harris has demonstrated (new, 1982, No. 50; cm, 1980, No. 27; cm,
1977. No. 4) that the use of cigarette paper made without Caco filler results
in very low smolder rates and hence low sidestream deliveries. The major
disadvantage is that due to the reduced smolder rate, the puff count is
extraordinarily high ("20-25 puff/sis). He suggested that unusual
puff counts.

Prototype DET-lll682-B was prepared with Caco -free cigarette paper
(supplied by Schweitzer) and 27.5mm long non air-diluted filters made with
2.9/44.000'tow. NOW 100 blend (high 6-13 level) was used in an effort to
reduce the puff count to acceptable levels. The results of smoke analyses are
presented in Table 1. It is clear that as compared to WINSTON KS (SS 'tar'
‘ZSmg/cix). substantial reductions ('50!) in measured sidestream 'tar' were
achieved while satisfactory mainstream delivery and acceptable puff count were
obtained.

Prototype DET-lllGBZ-A was similar to that described above except that the
filler included 302 “carbonized" flue-cured stems (obtained from Mr. J. Uhite).
Mr. White has demonstrated that the use of "carbonized" filler in a blend
results in reduced sidestream deliveries. The results of smoke analyses for
this prototype are also presented in Table l. A comparison of samples A and B
shows that the use of “carbonized“ fill’er resulted in further sidestream 'tar'
reduction. The sidestream 'tar' analysis for prototype A must be regarded as
method for measurement of sidestream 'tar' is in error for cigarettes which
contain “carbonized" filler. The actual 'tar' delivery is somewhat less than
that measured due to a higher extinction coefficient for SS 'tar' from

cigarettes with "carbonized" filler. Thus, all we can say at this point is
that the sidestream 'tar' reduction is in excess of ‘602.
The results of visible sidestream measurements are unavailable at this

the visible sidestream is very low.

Dear Dr. Wu:

Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to
enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a. brochure describing
policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a
preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step,
potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for
which support is sought. It should contain the following information:
1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.

2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be
taken. ,

3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The
Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for
one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress
reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. ,

It would also be helpful to have:

level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.

2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely
related to the project for which funding is being sought.

Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory
research program. The reviewerseither encourage or discourage submission of a formal
detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two
months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided.
Submission deadlines for M (not preliminary) applications are May 31 and November 30;


Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Wakehat:
A: a meeting held in the c0V1“8ton and Burling offices in Washington,
D. C., November 19, 1969, Industry scientists replied to Dr. perry Hudson's
criticisms of the Chemosol protocols.

At the end of the day, the American Chemosol Corporation representatives,
Mr. Roche and Mr. Beck, agreed to proceed with the program as detailed in the
two protocols. It is presumed that Mr. Austern obtained the agreement in

writing. Mr. Austern requested me to notify the Industry scientific
representatives of the agreement.

Corporation and the Industry ralated to benzo(a)pyrene analyses Mr. Gargus
stated that such analyses would be performed routinely on Control and
Chemosol-treated cigarette condensates. Mr. Beck pressed strongly for
making such data available immediately to the American Chemosol Corporation.
Mr. Austern made it clear that such data would not be released before
Hazleton‘s final report was issued.

This is a good Opportunity for me to express my appreciation for the
excellent cooperation, hard work, and scientifir competence of Dr. Burke and
Mr. Carpenter, my subcommittee colleagues. It's a shame that so much quality

work has had to be expended on something like Chemosol.

I am also grateful to the Research Directors for their cooperation and
understanding.

Sincerely yours.

Dear Ray:

The R. J. Reynolds corporate schedule in Redbook magazine is now the
equivalent of 23 national page which qualifies all advertising for the
18 to 25 page discount. This discount is 17;; for advertising placed in
issues January through June and 19; for advertising, scheduled from July
through the end of this year.

It would be to the advantage of Reynolds to consider scheduling at least
advertising scheduled for this year eligible for the next discount level,_
sulting in a savings of $24,942. » ,

. To take advantage of this Opportunity Reynolds would have to schedule
the additional page insertion in either the November or December issues
since the closing date for October has passed. I'IIIISTCI‘I and VANTAGE are
both scheduled for the November and December issues thus SAll-i-i or DORAL

scheduled for the w sue, while DOl‘xAL is not scheduled for either

Re: NORTHWOODS LOGGER CAMPAIGN — CAMPAIGN PORTFOLIO STUDY

Background And Objectives

 

WINSTON Full Flavor has recently switched its national advertising

from the Candid campaign to the Northwoods Logger campaign. It
was decided to run the new campaign based on positive results from

previous research on the Logger execution from the Occupational
campaign. This research suggested that individual executions from

the new campaign would be impactful and would communicate the
was desirable to determine the degree to which the new campaign
might approach the Marlboro campaign in potential for the total
campaign to communicate not only good taste, but more importantly


 

_ lawn...” _-,—_ ......,,.,

Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows:

1. Determine potential campaign communication in terms of smoker
imagery and product benefits.
..~.....-.~.—-x. ,w— .. —-

2. Assess the perception of the Northwoods Logger personality image.
a. Determining whether the personality imagery is highly defined
/single minded.

. .. .1...‘ m..." an...”

b. Determining what is the definition of the personality image.

c. Assessing how the personality image of the Northwoods Logger ;

smoker.

Summary Of Findings

In terms of campaign communication, it appears that the major gain
annnmn1ished by the new campaign relative to Candid is communication

....... r._---.vv~ .—

of a more fully dimensionalized, rugged, masculine smoker imagery.
The smoker imagery communicated by the new campaign is much richer
than that communicated by Candid and tends to be comparable to that
communicated by the Marlboro campaign. Given the greater involve-
ment of the Northwoods Logger campaign respondents in smoker imagery,
the taste communication for the new campaign is somewhat lower than
that generated by Candid. However, taste communication for the g
Northwoods Logger campaign is superior to that achieved by the 3
Marlboro campaign. -

.Dear Sir:

, ” (Anti—Smoking Bill)

Robert, I am very happy you wrote me because we people up
here in the hinterland don't hear very much about these

. Bills, and who is lobbying for or against them, until they

I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL because I myself was
a smoker for about so years. .Now, here I sit with an . .
I applaud every young man and every young woman who chooses
not to smoke. They show respect for the rights of others by
first demonstrating respect for their own bodies. What a
thoughtful example they are to all people (everyone from the
‘youngest infant to the oldest great grandparent) when they ‘
refuse to follow the example of their smoking elders. It is
adults who smoke who should be shamed by them. How asinine

' of those adults who smoke to ask that they be allowed to '
continue that travesty: - . I,. .

I am glad you indicated that your firm is Legislative Counsel
for the Tobacco Institute. Now, please show self-respect and
respect for the rights of ALL people who breathe air, by in; ‘,
sisting that tobacco find other legitimate uses-—uses which do ‘f:*
not infringe on the rights of all human beings who have a right r._
to breathe unpolluted air. - . v - ‘ .,- ’"

I know I can't defeat you lawyers but I can keep "pecking away"
and maybe, some day, I can sit down in a public place to eat
without having smoke blown into my face; maybe I can listen to
a speech or hear some music in a public place without enduring
asphyxiated by cigarette smoke in the waitineroom before I
get to see him. ' ' - ' n

Just last night I consulted my doctor because I was choking.

You can be sure I will contact my representative and tell him m
I will hold him personally respoﬁiiglgbif this bill fails to pass-

Re: SALEM Long Lights POS

The purpose of this memorandum is to confirm our

of "starbursts" on the SALEM Long Lights low pro-
file riser card. The Brand Group recommends that
"starbursts" not be used along with the SALEM

Long Lights low profile riser card. This action
has been taken due to legal restrictions relating
to live advertising space on the POS item. Fi-

With reference to the attached letter from
Mr. Croce, you can tell him that we do not add any
oxidizing agents to our tobaccos and insofar as we
nothing is added to tobacco to increase the rate of

burning.

Some cigarette papers do contain a very small
amount of additive to increase the burning rate of the
paper only so that it will burn evenly with the tobacco
and prevent cigarettes from "going out".

I am attaching also a photocopy of an
article that appeared in TOBACCO concerning "measure-

ment of the combustion-zone temperature of cigarettes".
It is to be noted that the combustion—zone temperature

is held within a narrow range regardless of the many
variables. Our own work confirms the results which are
reported.

I am returning Mr. Croce's letter herewith.

RE: Use of Brand Nantes on Matchbooks dig;

Dear Mr Blynn:

I now chair the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement Committee. The Committee has your
letter dated May 10, 2000, which responds to our letter of April 13, 2000, wherein we expressed
our view that Brand Name advertising on matchbooks violates section III(f) ofthe Master
Settlement Agreement (M SA). We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G. Gaston,

attorney for DD. Bean & Sons, Co. We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by
your position.

The distinctions cited in your letter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are
“merchandise" within the meaning of the MSA. As we previously explained, matchbooks are
sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not ﬁt within
any of the exceptions speciﬁed in section Ill(f). Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole
function is not advertising of Tobacco Products, and they are not written or electronic
publications. Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name
Merchandise imposed by section Ill(f)i

Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that
the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use . . .any Brand
Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself.”

The following are some of the questions which I believe
bear examination in future research on the effects of Cigarette
Smoking on the pregnant mother, the fetus and placenta, and the
child. As you will note many are those I formulated for the
chapter on Pregnancy and Infant Health for the 1979 Surgeon'
General‘s Report on Smokina and Health. (I apologize for the
sketchy nature of some of these questions, but I am writing

this letter during a few hours between a trip to Boston and
another to Amsterdam.)

To: The Members of the Management Committee

FROM! Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. 553:0,

Enclosed for your review prior to our conference call November 16
are The Institute staff's recommendations for 1993 creative and
media buys for the “Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" and "It's the
Law" print campaigns. These materials include a narrative
describing the rationale for the proposed insertion schedule, the
new creative work, and the budget. As with all program
materials, our audience is adults. By way of summary:
 

"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No"

Three different creative concepts are included in the 1993
"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" print advertising package
(Tab 1).

The first, "It's Tough Growing Up," complements the print
messages for 1991 and 1992, and continues to dovetail the themes
placement in general consumer books and minority publications, at
a budget totaling $694,000 for general consumer (down $256,000
from 1992) and $85,000 for minority media (down $10,000).

A second ad, "Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up," has
been designed for decision maker publications and continues to
promote both the youth and "It's the Law" components of the
industry's youth initiatives. The 1993 budget for decision maker

The third ad, also headlined "Smoking should Not Be A Part of
Growing Up," is designed for the education trade press and is the
same ad that began running midway through 1992. Because the
educator audience is the peer group of the Family COURSE
Consortium members, the Consortium is designated as the sponsor
of this ad, made possible by a grant from The Institute. This
sponsorship again dovetails the designation carried by the PSAs.
A full-year schedule for the education press is budgeted at
$25,000 (a $5,000 increase).

‘Product Guidance

a An analysis of mean, actual and ideal product attribute ratings among
18-34 year old FF NM and FFLT NM smokers was conducted for the WINSTON
brand research group to provide background information for the revised
WINSTON product action standards. Although no statistical significant
differences were run for this rating summary, the following similarities

- The FF NH 85mm female smokers appear to want a somewhat less strong,
less harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste than the male counter-
parts. However, all of their product ideal ratings in relation to
their actual product ratings are in the same direction as the male

category.

- The FFLT NM 85mm female smokers also appear to want a less strong, less
However, the female and male actual ratings are diametrically posi-
tioned in relation to their ideals on strength and tobacco taste.
Specifically, the females want a less strong tasting cigarette with
slightly less tobacco taste, whereas the males want a stronger tasting
cigarette with significantly more tobacco taste.

a A review of open—end responses from a recent Project SM Product Guidance
Test was conducted to provide insight and ideas for the development of a
new chewing tobacco questionnaire. Results indicate that respondents
cite many quality of flavor and aroma attributes which are not asked on
tobacco flavor, artificial taste, sour taste, licorice taste and sweet
tions from the tobacco, indicating a need to further explore the mouth

feel dimension of the product.

from preliminary results. Maximum ratings for overall acceptance are
associated with high tar levels. In general, of the two tar influencing
variables studied, air dilution is of much greater importance than filter
pressure in affecting attribute movement. Response surfaces for
strength, tobacco taste, rich taste and natural taste all have contours
similar to those for overall acceptance measures, with maximum ratings
along ridges at moderate to lower air dilutions irrespective of filter

Dear Tom:
Thank you very much for your standbyconsultation fee.

Enclosed are the corrected graphs for you and Dr. Little. You may use
them any way you like. I listed the components of total respiratory so
it would be clear that asthma, bronchitis, tuberculosis and respiratory
cancer were included as well as emphysema and bronchitis, and that the
separate rates are included in the total rates. The rates for the last
two conditions are too small to consider separately.
This makes quite a case for improved classification. After going down
with the introduction of antibiotics, influenza and pneumonia are now
going the same route as reported respiratory cancer mortality. The so
called Hong Kong ﬂu in 1968, gave that death rate another jump, so it
is on the general ascendant course. .

My work on the longer document continues. I have all the mortality data
on hand and will make a report with Bill Alban in the next two or three

weeks .

I have my other file of cases completely processed for Negroes, but not
but need to be checked for duplicates. When I have the printout of the

40, 000 plus cases in Houston, and compare them with the 200, 000 plus
deaths from all causes, I will first check the 162, 163 classifications and
see what the facts were. I have been asked to put this article in the Inter-
tion base cancer cases in Houston are available and may be checked against

Dear Tom:

The compilation put together by the staff is impressive,
cancer research. Actually, the list is a short one. when
the Scientific Advisory Board and funded by CTR, one finds
considerable important data that might not otherwise have
been made available to the scientific community.

Looking back to when I first became associated with CTR,
it is becoming increasingly evident that there are many
weaknesses in the epidemiological and other work some
people rely on when they blame cigarette smoking as being
the major cause of lung cancer and other ailments.

The deficiencies of the tobacco causation hypothesis
and the need of much research are becoming clearer to in-
creas1ng numbers of research scientists.

I know there are many investigators who look at the to-
bacco hypothesis uith an unbiased and impartial eye and
find that it has been over—simplified, and over-interpreted.
instilled fear in the mind' of many people. This is to' be
deplored, the more so because it is not based on good,
honest science

Tb insist that scientific conclusions be based firmly
on critical and unbiased research is an essential element

’in the search for truth.:I am convinced the truth will come


‘I am proud of my years with CTR. I know the members of
the SAB are proud and grateful for the opportunity to de-
velop a program that is aimed only at providing informa-
tion;

The industry can take pride in its support of CTR
through the years. The program of the SAB is a worthy one
and has contributed much to the advancement oﬁ scientific
knowledge. Certainly, it is, in my opinion, the largest
and most intensive such program in the world and, I feel,
the most productive in terms of getting solid findings in
the area in which we are interested.

with kindest regards .

Dr. H. Y. Rice and A. J. Sensabaugh have recently conducted a series of
experiments which resulted in cigarette smoke condensate displaying markedly
reduced biological activity. These experiments involved the application of
aqueous burley extract to flue-cured-tobacco and preparation of cigarettes

condensate from resulting test cigarettes (burley extract enhanced flue-cured)

Dear Mr. Hoyt:

Dr. Kouri and Dr. Henry have had conversations with Dr. Lisanti
relative to the timetable we were following for the Final Report
and manuscript preparation on Contract 0030. I thought it would be
appropriate for me to drop you this note to let you know the current

Over the Christmas holidays we ran into some serious computer

hardware problems which resulted in our falling behind schedule by
approximately one week. Then last week Dr. Kouri‘s best friend was
killed in an automobile accident, causing us to lose a week of his

input. Thus we are behind our original target by two weeks and,
therefore, I would like to revise the deadline for submission of

the Final Report to January Blst. Since the manuscripts are in
tandem and will be generated from the Final Report Data Base, the

completion date for the two manuscripts would be rescheduled to
March 3lst.

appreciate your understanding in the matter. I have seen the work
they are generating and feel certain that you will be quite pleased
and impressed with the Final Report.
Sincerely,

The following white paper by Doug Weber discusses the future development of

the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories. This document is in response to
your request for a "think piece" on how these two categories might develop in

the next five years.

in the amount of growth achieved by the Price-Conscious and Prestige
industry competitive actions and reactions, marketing resource availability,
technical capabilities, and economic and social pressures facing cigarette

C0118 ume I'S o

Also included is a description of factors that may impact the likelihood of
each scenario and the future development of the market.

Finally, we have included specific recommendations for RJR. These
recommendations address the need to:

1. Prevent the occurrence of an RJR competitive disadvantage in the
Price-Conscious category. Specifically, we need to be prepared to

introduce new Price-Conscious brands, plot potential competitive
moves, and increase our intelligence activities to ensure ourselves

maximum lead-times.

2. Explore all possible opportunities and positions within the Prestige
category.

3. Place high priority on the development of products and other elements

of our marketing mix that will provide us superior brand propositions
and competitive advantages. This could be done through improved
technologies, more efficient distribution systems, and more effective
promotional tools.

As you requested, this document has been reviewed by Marty Orlowsky and Harry

BRIGHT Retail Shelf Life Study

Two samples of BRIGHT (November 1982 and June 1983) were
picked up from retail along with SALEM Ultra Light 85 (November
1982 and May 1983). Separate diagnostic tests were conducted
products showed differences on seven of the fourteen attributes.
Of particular interest were less menthol flavor, minty flavor
and cooling sensation. SUL 85 showed differences on three of
the fourteen attributes. None of these were menthol related.
The results were provided to Brands and have been reported to
Marketing by them.

Garniture Injection

Implementation of garniture injection on NOW 100 Menthol
has been postponed due to product relocation in Manufacturing.
An AR for this change is being routed. '

Reducing Casing for 6-13-14

Completed MDD (M/A/R/C) tests indicated that franchise
smokers could not discriminate either test formula: (1) with
50% of the 6-13 casing removed from the control or (2) with
50% of casing transferred from 6-13-14 to Part II. Seven major
brands were tested. Cost estimates have been requested to be
completed by July 25.

An AR prOposing the 50% casing reduction on all G-13-14
has been put on hold pending a review of all G-13 projects.

Dear Dr. Stone,
The Radiation Research Society is holding its thirty—seventh annual
of its type in the world, and typically has more than 1000 participants at
the annual meeting. One of the sessions, which I have been asked to
organise, is a Workshop on "The Interaction Between Radon Exposure and
Smoking." A brief description of the workshop, and the participants, is
enclosed, the former to be included in the conference program book. In
light of our phone conversation, it would be most helpful and extremely
app1opriate if the Council for Tobacco Research could sponsor the seminar,
in terms of a contribution of, say, $2500, towards the tiavel expenses of
the participants. An appropriate acknowledgement would, of course, appear
in the conference program.

Closer to home, our own laboratory has been doing a considerable amount
of research into the biological effects of radon in vitro, and is planning
to do some experiments with alpha particles simulating radon daughters and
with tobacco smoke condensate, to look for possible synergistic interactions
he in—vitro oncogenic transformation. As our experience with tobacco smoke
condensate is limited, would you be interested in coming to give us a
seminar — or a more informal discussion — on tobacco research in general?
Our laboratory has a seminar series, and a small honorarium is usual.

I enclose our laboratory annual report, and my own C.V., to give you a
feel for the scope of our activities. Please feel free to give me a call,

With best regards,

Introduction

Nearly 10,000,000 children less than titre years of age. living intthe, United
. Twenty-five percent of pregnant women continue to smoke throughout their . .
pregnancy. Although the overall rate of smoking in us. society has been decreasing
during the two and one-half decades since the Surgeon General's report on the
adverse effects of tobacco, the exposure risk to young Children. particularly those living
in low income or black families, remains at 50-60 percent. ‘ “‘ ‘

Involuntary exposure to ETS affects children in three different ways. First, pre-
natal exposure potentlally can have a marked impact on totalybody‘ development
including lung. brain, and size development. Additionally, premature delivery and
spontaneous abortion are related to maternal smoking. Second, post-nataliy the
growing child may have effects of ETS which impact on the heart. iungs,‘{_lmmUne
system, ears, brain, and even survival itself. Third, and possibly mostnimportant.
childhood exposure to ETS impacts on the child's decision to engage in‘actliIe
smoking and other self-injurious medical behaviors 2 which meet likelywill continue
into adulthood and will compound the effects of perinatal ETS exposure. . 2

Non-Respiratory Effects

The potentially injurious effects of ETS on a child's health are? both non-
respiratory and respiratory. Although the recently described correlation between ETS .
and blood cholesterol in children is significant 3, the non-respiratory effect that maybe
. most important is the relationship between ET S and sudden .infant'dea‘th syndrome4 -
or SIDS - because mortality from SIDS during childhood is potentially preventible.

TO: Editors and writers on women's subjects

Because the tobacco and health controversy has increasingly
focused on women and smoking, I am enclosing the latest Tobacco
Institute publication which addresses this issue. I hope you
will find a way to make your readers aware of its contents and
its availability, free of charge, rom The Tobacco Institute.
Whether it be the issue of women and smoking, or any of the other
controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products, we
sincerely believe that a full, free and informed discussion of
the issues is in the public's best interest. We agree with

the American Cancer Society's conviction that, "adult individuals
must make up their own minds about smoking but, it requires

that individuals know the facts."

For too long, adversaries of tobacco have attempted to influence
those adult personal decisions, as well as public policy, with
assumptions, opinions or conjectures not supported by scientific
or medical fact.

FACT gg FANCY? was produced to present more factual, and balanced,
answers on the health question about which mature women need

 

If we may provide any further information to you or your readers,

We have completed our preliminary review of the
economic impact of implementing the proposed “Clean Indoor
Air" ordinance in Dade County, Florida. The purpose of this
magnitudes of these impacts and to develop study approaches
for a more detailed estimate in areas where impact appears

preliminary review.

Work done

In performing this review We have studied the
the State of California in connection with the proposed
”Proposition 5", compiled data for Dade County about the
number of facilities and employees in different categories
which could be impacted, performed some small surveys in
order to evaluate assumptions which had been made in
connection with the California survey, and computed an
impact using cost factors which were developed as a part of

the California study adjusted for the results of our local
surveys and interviews.


Based upon our review we believe that there will be
a near term cost impact in Dade County in both the Public and

Private Sectors. In attempting to quantify this impact we
encountered the following difficulties:

Dear Andre,

two projects which we are to offer for PILC work

with the Smoke/Technology Groups. I thought you
-would like to have details to be able to present

a more detailed programme at the meeting in Florence.

l. Nitrogen sources and nitrous oxide in smoke

We will have tobacco from three sources of nitrOgen,
ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate and urea. This is
a properly replicated trial so we can give them up
to ten replications. '

2. Effect of sucker control compounds on leaf quality

We can supply up to four replications of cured leaf

treated with n—decanol, octonol decanol mixtures,
Prime Plus (CGA41065) Bud Nip (chlorpropham),

Accotab (pendimethalin), Tamex (butralin), FST-7
(n—decanol plus potassium salt of maleic hydrazide)
and several others.

From both these trials we will have yield and quality
from Smoke group. Our tobacco will be available at the
end of April 1984.
I hope this will be useful in presenting your case in
Florence.

Yours sincerely,

Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine
Albert Einstein College of Medicine

Belfer Building Rm. 1302

1300 Morris Park Avenue

Bronx, NY 10461-1601

Dear Dr. Kabat:

I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL.
Am. J Epidemiol. 142(2): 141-8, 1995), and noted a logical inconsistency that likely

indicates a minor error,

Speciﬁcally, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in
childhood as 0.90 for “yes” (i.e., any exposure), 1.12 for “1 smoker in the household,”
and 1.13 for “2+ smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition
the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes" should be some weighted average of the
OR’s for the sub-categories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is,
unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe,
be incorrect.

I calculated crude OR’s and CPS from your published case and control counts for each
exposure category and was surprised to ﬁnd that the cru_de results for “yes/no” identically
replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142
that “[u]nconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with
adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2
contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state if the results in Table
2 are, or are not, adjusted. My calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household”
was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2.06) and for “2+ smokers in the household“ was 0.87 (95% CI:
0.31-2.45). These calculated crude sub-category results are logically consistent with the
published, dichotomous “yes/no” results.

The Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition has notiﬁed RJR that it is
conducting a “non-public investigation“ to determine if RJR is engaging in unfair methods of

competition or unfair practices by entering into agreements with retailers to maintain the prices
of cigarettes. . .

As part of the FTC' s notiﬁcation of the existence of this inquiry. the FTC has requested

RJR to produce a number of types of documents that are described herein below and to
preserve these types of documents. * -

The purpose of this memo is to informycu of the existence of the FTC‘s Investigation
and to alert you to the requirement that we suspend our normal document retention programs

SUBJECT: Petition Against Tobacco Regulation
In October, we sent you petition packs to combat a very serious threat by the anti-tobacco
forces to encourage the food and drug administration (FDA) to place severe regulations on

cigarettes. The petitions were to be placed at selected retail locations.

Thus far. the responses have been minimal and we encourage you to follow-up with retailers to
return completed petitions as soon as possible. The deadline for petition returns has been

extended to December 31 1994.

 

The threat against our industry is very real. The power shift in Congress in no way diminishes
this threat. Our goal Is to demonstrate, by the petitions we receive, that smokers and the
general public are against any further regulations on tobacco.

Dear Don:

It was lovely to talk to you on the phone. As I have said to you my outlook of
life is now different. May I please request an extension without further funding
of our grant entitled “Investigation into the Role of Regulatory Peptides in Human
Lung Disease" Grant No. 1438A, which we have held jointly with Steve Bloom for the
past years. The reason is the that we have now established a very strong link
with our colleague surgeons, in particular Professor Magdi Yacoub from Harefield
involved in heart lung transplants.

We have done sufficient pilot experiments to be able to say that a number of novel
techniques are now established in our Unit, over and above biochemical numerical
estimation and chemical characterisation of extractable peptides, and their
autoradiography for the mapping and characterisation of binding sites—and in situ
hybridisation/Nothern blot analysis for the study of the mRNA directing ‘—
neuropeptide/endocrine peptide synthesis. These techniques now work very well in
human tissue and we have established a baseline to investigate pathology. Unlike
earlier days when availability of human diseased lung and heart tissue was
difficult, now we have increased use of surgical transplantation technology. This
material is plentiful and fully available. The potential of investigating
diseased state in human applying modern technology is therefore with us and we
would very much like to urite up an exciting extension grant application to the
best of our abilities and hence our delay. These techniques could open up a new
field of investigative pathology.

 
I very much hope this will not cause too much inconvenience to the Council for
Tobacco Research and I look forward to hearing from you.

Placervlile. CA 95667


Enclosed for your consideration is the dratt smoking ordinance prepared by the Clean Indoor
Air and Health Protection Coalition. Although the draft ordinance passed by a vote of 7-to-1.
we feel that it is important to express the different viewpoints of the committee members. This
latter attempts to present both the majority and minority opinions of our group.

The majority of the members at the committee feel that anything short of an 100 percent
smoke-free ordinance is not favorable to the health and safety of the public. The majority
believe that smoke flows freely from smoking to non-smoking areas. and too percent smoke-
tree la the only way to protect both employees In the workplace and the public at large. The
minority group would rather allow businesses to set their own policies and avoid mandating
policy altogether.

The primary clifierencs of opinion centers around protecting the rights of business owners to
set policy versus protecting the nonsmoking public. The minority position of the committee
believe that since there is no threshold established for the amount of second-hand smoke that
is hazardous. we do not have sufficient basis to establish a 100 percent smoke-free policy.
They feel that each business owner should be allowed to set their own smoking policy. The
majority believe that a threshold Is not necessary. Second-hand smoke has been proven to
believe that second-hand smoke is hazardous to nonsmokere' health.

Another area oi disagreement Is in the treatment of employees. Many members believe that
all businesses should be treated the some. Allowing smoking sections in restaurants will
expose employees to second-hand smoke, but the ordinance requires all other businesses to
provide smoke-free air for empioyees. Please refer to the attached letter from Betty Turner,
Policy Director of the American Lung Association for further explanation.

Dear Mike,
Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency
at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note
summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas
aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities.

improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on
Oxide additives such as Naz and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering
with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress
concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data
look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed
the General Accounting Office (GAO) draft report entitled
”Regulations of Cancer-Causing Food Additives —— Is It Time

for a Change?“
The report discusses the Delaney Clause of the 1958
Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, which directs the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to ban the use of cancer—causing food additives.
According to the draft report, food safety experts believe
the Delaney Clause should be changed because of its
inflexibility; however, they disagree on alternative
regulations to the present statute.

mandating the approaches used by EPA, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA). For this reason and also
because of advances in scientific methodology, uncertainties
about the human risks from low-level carcinogens and the
inflexibility that exists under the Delaney Clause, GAO
recommends that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

these findings provide a sound basis for GAO's recommendation
that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

Dear Store Manager:

For the past year, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has been actively seeking
support from the retail community in its fight to reduce underage smoking.
Since August of 1992, RJR has sent materials (literature as well as in-store
signage) on its youth non-smoking program, "Support The Law...It Works," to
over 20,000 retail outlets across the country. Over half of these stores have
requested additional material and information about the program.
In addition, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has had the privilege of having
Mr. Danny Glover, actor and parent, visit several cities, including New
Orleans, and speak to retailers about the importance of supporting this

It is my understanding that you may not be aware of this program so I am
sending a brochure that will provide you with pertinent information and what
materials are available. If you are already participating in the "Support The
Law" program, or something similar, thank you for your involvement. If you
are not participating in this program and would like to know more about it,
please review the brochure and send in for additional material using the
attached business reply card. All materials are available free of charge.

Thank you for helping us keep cigarettes out of the hands of kids. Remember,
when we all support the law...it works!

'Re: Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA)
Dear Mr. Andree:

You have contacted us in regard to the legality of certain cigarette mannfacturers’ promotions
under the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA). This letter is in response to that inquiry.

As you are aware, the Department issued TSB-M-OO (2)M on March 3, 2000 stating that
certain manufacturers’ promotional programs known as “buy-downs" and “master-type" programs
are prohibited under CMSA. Please reference that memorandum for details. It is the Department’s
view that any change with regard to “buy-downs" and “master-type” programs would require
statutory change by the Legislature.

Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of
promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the
manufacturer's invoice and “buy one, get one free“ (or buy some, get some free) promotions. These
programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction
(including any price reduction due to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer’s invoice; (2) all
cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer’s brands in New—York State are allowed to participate
in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to speciﬁed retail dealers (other than for
purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product). The industry has
also offered manufacturer's coupons. These are allowable under CMSA, provided that the coupon
is either published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation, or mailed directly to the
consumer by the manufacturer.

Dear Dr. Silverman:

Thank 'you for your interest in our program Cf research support. I am pleased to enclose
our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the
last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses
several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific
instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by
members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists
who serve as our peer review committee.

Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit
institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two
or three years) in a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an
award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding

The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the
Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. We ask that you
complete the enclosed "Current and Pending Support" form since some consideration is
given to your current funding level. Complete scientific freedom is assured and ouronly
expectation is publication of research results in appropriate peer-reviewed journals.

Dear Dr. Lisanti:

i am writing to you concerning the feasibility study of
drNicotine and gamma-pyridyl—)Coxobutyric acid (POBA). Some problems
have arisen concerning the av ailability of some chemicals that we
need to complete the study and we would like to ask to extend the study
through July lst. We have found that racemization occurs at the
elevated temperature (250°C) and pressure as indicated in our previous
report. it is now clear that the yield obtained by this approach is
very low and would be of the order of h~5% which makes the method
impractical for preparing large amounts of dwNicotine. We are there-
fore evaluating lower temperature (e.gq 170°C). The chemical synthesis
of racemic nicotine looks promising and may be the best solution. How-
ever, until the backordered chemicals arrive we will not be able to
complete the study. it appears that we have liquidated the world's
We have investigated the McKennis synthesis method of PDBA
and are not at all happy with the procedure or the yield. As an
alternative we are looking at the reaction of 3-pyridylmagnesiumbromide
with succinic anhydride as a possible one-step synthesis. Results of
these studies will be discussed in our next report.

Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter
Sheet Material

The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on
cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test
product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaCO3.
(Sample G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to
30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal—
ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 i 2985 ug/cigarette, i.e.
4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in
the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 ug/
test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 ug/cigarette) and

silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066
pg silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS.
The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaCO3 present
in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash >99%. The
amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The
amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no
greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit

As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton
linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of
up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G).

Dear Dr. Lisanti:

on the coefficient, Yule's Q.

Q is a measure of association between two variables that have each
been classified into dichotomies. Thus it contrasts with the most
conventional measure of association, Pearson's Product—moment Corre—
lation (r),in that the latter relates two variables that are each
measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both
measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing
perfect direct orinverse associations, respectively.

Pearson‘s r isbased on the product moments for each data point
represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted
requires interval seals measuring the variables.

In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points
on the scales. Onlybwo points are represented for each variable
(e.g. — high x low, on x off, cancer x non-cancer, etc). The data
are thus classiﬁigg into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack).

A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F.

Re: PHOENIX METRO - TUCSON INCLUSION

I've had a chance to review all pertinent data regarding
the inclusion of Tucson into the Phoenix Metro definition
and I recommend we remain as previously agreed —- that
being Metro Phoenix defined as Maricopa County.

Rationale

Without going into deep specifics, the reasoning in support
of my recommendation is:

: "'ZL‘ ~ mt A' t * ¥ “t d

hence, no reason to include Tucson from a

media purchase standpoint.

As Jack Grossman pointed out in his document
to you on 9/1, the markets are extremely
similar with regard to demographic makeup;
hence, what problems/opportunities we identify
demographically for Phoenix should be trans—

ferable to the Tucson market.
— Both markets are growing at an above—
average rate -— 30%+ last 10 years.

— Both are nearly identical in % popula—
tion under 35: Phoenix 59.9%, Tucson

59ul%.

- Both have equal splits as to males/

49% to 51%.

DearMessrs. Freedman & Cromer:

Thank you for your correspondence of March 3 and March 5, 1999, providing
additional information about your Ohio billboards so we could proceed with our
telephone, Ohio will proceed with placement of alternative advertising on all available
suitable and comparable substitute space of equivalent value.

Jane Kilgore of our Public Affairs staff has carefully reviewed the several lists
you provided and communicated directly with each of the outdoor advertising ﬁrms that
own or sell the space. Attached is the list of billboards we have compiled for placement
of Ohio’s alternative advertising program. In most instances, the billboards are those
you listed, and we have conﬁrmed availability with the vendor. In those instances
where the billboards were no longer available, we have arranged for substitute space of
equivalent value. Any such billboards are included in the attached list. For example,
Cleveland Outdoor Advertising informed us that the 14x48 billboard at W. 117 and [-90

Extended Puff Count, Lower C0 Delivery And Improved Conductive

Heat Transfer In TGA Models Using A Macrocapsule With Thermally
Conductive Aluminum "Fingers"


 

The conductionnof heat from the burning fuel source in a TGA
macrocapsule can be improved with the use of aluminum "fingers"
which extend out from the macrocapsule and surround the fuel
source. These fingers are actually part of the capsule but extend
the length of the fuel source thus providing a ready path for the
conduction of heat. Furthermore, this improved heat transfer
serves to sink out more heat from the burning fuel thus lowering
its.combustion temperature. The result is two-fold: (1) the rate
of carbon gasification is reduced and as a result the fuel is
carbonaceous reduction of CO is decreased because of the lower
temperature maintained in the burning coal.

Background

Conductive heat transfer in a TGA model from a burning fuel
source back to the substrate occurs chiefly through the aluminum
macrocapsule. The fuel source is generally”inserted only 1 or 2
mm inside the macrocapsule. The heat must travel from the burning
fire cone, down the unburnt fuel rod and then across the l to 2 mm
interface to the capsule. By improving the efficiency of this
conductive heat transfer, more heat can be delivered to the
substrate, sooner, thus permitting earlier flavor and/or aerosol
delivery. The approach taken in this invention is to improve the
interface between fuel source and macrocapsule. In this regard, a
new type of macrocapsule is used which contains a number of
finger-like protrusions which extend the length of the fuel
source. The heat is transferred not only at the interface where

the fuel scurce is inserted into the capsule but also along these

* Mainstream and sidestream ’TPM’ fractions from the Beta 90
nicotine and glycerol fate in total smoke studies have been
combined and concentrated in preparation for determination of
levels of intact starting materials (percentage of radioactivity
that is due to unchanged nicotine or glycerol). This is a tedious
process because care has to be taken not to lose any
radioactivity during concentration.

* Experiments have been designed, solutions prepared and time
scheduled to determine the fates of nicotine and glycerol in 3
more Beta 90 protocepts. These studies will start on 8/15/89.

* Currently consulting with Bill Needs to determine the best
statistical approach for evaluation of the data already obtained.

SUBJECT: American Heart Association
Miami, Nov. 17-20, 1980

The AHA‘s annual session has become one of the largest med—
sentations and a huge display of drug companies and equipment
manufacturers. The size and complexity of the event prompted
the association's program committee chairman, in a speech on
"Science and Advertising," to point out certain aspects that

inars and special events at various hotels togprbmote certain.
drugs, and he even took a general shipe at scientists who en-
theses with insufficient data.

The press, which was well represented, discussed this in
terms of washing dirty linen, but wrote nothing about it. Nor
did the writers express other than casual interest in the sev-
Veral reports dealing with various aspects of smoking or the
press conferences that_contained the usual antismoking comments.

It is likely that the heart association will increase its
antismoking activities in 1981 because of its new president,

Dear Dr. Karin:

  
      
    
      
 
   
     

I am writing to you as a current or former grantee of The Council for Tobacco
Research, USA, Inc., in order to infomi you of one aspect of the agreement recently reached

by the Attorneys General of several states and representatives of the tobacco industry, our
funding sponsors.

This agreement, which will require Congressional legislation for implementation, calls
for disbanding and dissolving The Council for Tobacco Research within 90 days after such
legislation goes into effect. Anticipating that such legislation may be enacted, we have decided
that it will not be prudent for us to fund further grant applications,


Accordingly, we have suspended review of all new and competing renewal grant
applications. However, we intend to meet the obligations we have to current grantees, In short,
those of you who have an active grant with CTR can expect that our obligation to you “ill be
met, but no new grant applications or competing renewals will be considered.

General reﬂected a profound misunderstanding of the mission of CTR in supporting the
biomedical research community. It is unfortunate that this action \w'll deprive the scientiﬁc
community of $20 million dollars annually that might well be spent on important scientiﬁc
research. This ill-considered demand by the Attorneys General m'll penalize the biomedical

research community and the public at large. You have the collective good wishes of the staff of
The Council for Tobacco Research and our sponsors.

SB-1113 for the 18 cent cigarette excise tax increase and the bill
was referred to the Revenue Committee on Thursday, April 13, 1989.
If passed, this bill would have a major impact on many sectors of
the Illinois economy as well as our industry.

I invite you to evaluate this tax bill with Kurt L. Malmgren,

(Salem: #1 Priority Brand for NY Metro)

Dear Managers,

As we have discussed several times, the importance of getting a “Good Solid” read on the
share and volume performance in these small green zones is extremely important to the
eventual rollout ofthe new Salem nationally.

The reason for this is simply the fact that everything that the Green Zone / Green Team is
doing in our 12 test zones, is totally workable in the future FDA restricted environment.
new brand may be the only way! Does it relate to a national introduction plan or is it too
one billboard on the NJ turnpike could totally fund the Green Team activities for possibly
a full quarter.

In the next few days, we will be sending you (if you have green zones) the information
on manual tracking of purchases in selected green zone stores. This is the only good way
to get a read on our business. It will require our SR/TR’s to call on approximately 5 to 7
stores each week to gather sales/purchase data from invoices. Once the stores show that
they understand what information we need on a weekly basis, we can then use Retail
Representatives and possibly green team members to gather the information on a weekly
basis. There is no other way ..... and due to the tremendous importance ofthis Salem test
information, the stores that are willing to provide us with copies of invoices will receive a
weekly payment of approximately $20 per store.

In response to your request for information on two competitive brand syles, DAVE’s FF and
FFLT, I have reviewed various sources of information to determine the potential source of
this leaf based on the pesticide residues detected in product samples labeled 521 and 615.
Unfortunately, no conclusions can be made in this regard.

While residues of endosulfan and maleie hydrazide were detected, these two pesticides are
used/registered for use in several countries. Also, the residues are well below any of the limits
that have been established in these countries. Furthermore, these two pesticides can be
applied to more than one type of leaf. Though there are differences in pesticide formulations
which may/may not account for residue content; the duration in the field, weather conditions,

etc., can impact the degradation of these pesticides. Lastly, the effects of blending can dilute
the residue content in the final product.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance to you.

State Office Building
St. Paul MN 55155

Dear Senator Finn:

require far more difficult solutions than simply making

Minnesota’s tobacco tax the highest in the nation at the
expense of Minnesota’s businesses.

If Governor Carlson’s proposal goes through, one group of
businesses and consumers will bear the burden of paying for
a necessary and vital program. My only question to you is
this: what happens when those customers go elsewhere to buy
their tobacco and the state doesn’t collect the'amount of
money it needs to finance this program? Where will the
money come from next? Who is going to make the_decision on
who gets coverage and who doesn't when the money runs out?

Customers of Minnesota businesses and most importantly their
employees should not be the ones who have to pay the price
because Governor Carlson and some legislators think raising
tobacco taxes solves the problem of affordable and
accessible health care. We don't need gimmicks; we need
leadership.

Comparison of Silastic 73lRTV Dana June 26, l974
and 732RTV Sealants

Mr. E. L. Hall Front Larry A. Lyerly
Machine Shop Research Department
Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to
cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis
to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred.
The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts ,
of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat
larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be
essentially silicon dioxide (sand).

During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 73lRTV had
our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. I recommend
that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would
likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result

in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided.

Attached are data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status
of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and
the National Sanitation Foundation. Note that when thoroughly cured and washed,
732RTV has been approved under FDA Regulation No. l2l.2562 dealing with rubber
articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. Under the NSF Code,
732RTV has been approved for use in the splash zone and 73lRTV in the food zone.

Dear Governor Carlson:

I am wriling to you on behalf of Swedish Match North America Inc. (“SMNA”) to express
has recently bngurr to import alga-a into the United Staten Our product line is comprised of
cigars in all price segments (ii-om low priced to premium) and it is our intention to introduce over
30 varieties of cigars into the United States“ market. Accordingly, SMNA's entry into the United
States (and Minnesota) cigar market will foster greater competition and offer adult comumcrs of

Section 5 of RF. No. 117, however, represents a substantial barrier to SMNA’s entry of
the Minnesota cigar market. This section would require companies that sell cigars in Minnesota
to submit Innual reports which identity by brand. whether detectable levels of ammonia or any
burned or unburned state.

SMNA does not currently have in place any testing procedures to determine the presence
of these substances. It has never had a need to develop such procedures, because no other
country or state requires collection of this information. Moreover, the development of such
testing procedures would take algnlﬂcam time. SMNA would not be able to develop such
procedures prior to August 1. 1997 —- the date by which sellers of cigars in Minnesota must begin
to collect data. regarding and disclose the presence of the HP. No. ll'l enumerated substances. t
Finally, cvcn if n testing procedure could be developed in a timely rmmnnr, the cost of testing over
30 varieties; of cigars both in a burned and unburned state would be substantial.

Freud with these problems. SMNA simply could not tell its cigars in the state of
Minnesota Brscd upon SMNA': knowledge of the United States cigar industry, SMNA
anticipates that other relatively email cigar manufacturers and importers would he forced to minke
larger cigar manufacturers and imponers would be faced with this choice. In short, the impact of

Re: Distribution
Dear Bob:

Quite rightly, you people have been interested in the question of distribution
on Sir Walter Raleigh products as we plan Sir Walter Raleigh brand strategies.
information we haven't had before.

In general, it shows that distribution is in pretty good shape on Aromatic
within those sales departments Where the spring ﬂight will run. It alSQ
confirms our belief that New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco

are disasters. Chicago is mediocre; Frank Sonego (Department Manager)
improving brand distribution. His area stretches from central Indiana
out through Quad cities.

While distribution, like advertising, can always be improved, I guess, it seems
to me that our advertising will be reaching areas this spring where consume rs
can reasonably expect to go out and find Aromatic at their favorite stores.
PKG's nicely designed promotion brochure will be a good aid for plugging

the distribution gaps where they do exist.
Sincerely,

Jackie and Gentlemen:

Listed below are the answers to the ﬁve questions that you proposed on our recent conference call
relative to the Doral equity test.

1)

2)

3)


5)

If an account is willing to fund the $.50 differential between Doral and its branded competitive
set, this is acceptable.

However, ifthis becomes widespread. it would tiaw the test but I don't think the retailers will
reduce their margins by $.50.

The marquee/awning program can be sold and implemented in higher volume convenience gas
outlets and is not exclusive to cigarette outlets; however, CO's would be our ﬁrst priority.

The $.50 per carton/$.05 per pack applies to all trade segments. The bottom line is in the entire
retail universe within the Kansas City Division should reflect Doral $.05 less a pack/$.50 less a
carton vs. branded competitive sets.

Relative to the pricing survey issues, adjustments will be made which will reﬂect on strategy if
Doral is $.50 less a carton/$.05 less a pack vs. branded competitive sets.

The additional part-time labor request (32 hours a week) is still under consideration. Will advise

Sincerely.

In order to assist me with preparation of the 1985
Performance Plan Summary, please prepare a list in short concise
statements of your accomplishments during 1985. A few examples

are shown below:


An environmental smoke test chamber with appropriate
control of temperature, humidity, air flows, lighting, and
air leakage has been successfully constructed and is in

operation.

Studies of environmental smoke with various analytical
methods and instrumentation have clearly demonstrated that
the nicotine is found in the vapor phase of the aerosol.

An innovative UV absorption method has been developed to
measure the levels of HTS collected on chamber surfaces.

Denuder tube technology has been developed to aid in the
understanding of vapor—particulate partitioning in ETS.

An improved mass spectral search library specific for
sidestream bases has been developed.

The 6O per pack (21¢-27¢) excise tax bill in New Mexico passed the Senate and has been
sent to the House. The Governor stated this week that he would veto any tax increase bill
that came across his desk.

In Wyoming, the bill that removes the sales tax exemption from tobacco products passed the
Senate.

MSA Le islation

The New Jersey Assembly Health Committee has scheduled hearings on two settlement-
related bills — one to set up a Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund and another to require non-
participating manufacturers to pay into a reserve fund.

A California Senate bill has been introduced to implement the "renegade" provisions of the
MSA. A total of 12 bills have been introduced in the legislature that direct where money
revenues raised from Proposition 10, the 50¢ per pack ballot initiative that passed in
November.

Settlement related bills were also introduced in Connecticut and Vermont.

Dear Dr. Lisanti:

thelial cells and platelets. However, due to decreased
‘ funding for the period July 1977 thru June 1978, progress
erely impeded. This has resulted in a drastic change of
research priorities and has necessitated the deletion of
studies pertaining to platelets from this proposal.

Dr. Wu has submitted a separate proposal (including a sep—
arate budget and progress report) dealing with platelets
proposals and should be evaluated as such. Independent
budgets and possible budgetary cuts will effect either
endothelial cell studies g£_platelet studies and will not
require reallocation of decreased funds and hence decreased
productivity or elimination of specific aims in either of
the research areas. These two important research areas
should not have to compete for available funds Within the
same grant proposal.

We would appreciate your consideration of this problem
and the two separate proposals. If you have any questions
regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me.

area of lipoprotein metabolism. The manuscript is in the area of molecular
genetics. As will be apparent from the enclosed study, I am proposing to
combine my previous training and interests into a research program that
uses the techniques of molecular genetics to study the regulation of
lipoprotein metabolism and to determine genetic risk factors for heart
disease.

the correlation between water solubles in 6-7 and filling value. Correla-
extract levels decrease are now available. At this time, lowering the water
solubles content of 6-7 to increase filling value and thereby reduce costs
does not appear to be feasible due to the lack of availability of the addi-
tional stems‘and scrap required to make 6—7 with less water solubles.
However, the possibility of eliminating the G—9 dust extract as a means

of improving G-7 uniformity and quality is under investigation.

BACKGROUND

CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful

management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of

and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment.

A five—year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per
year. In 1983, SALEM became a co—advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL's
budget. Rate increases have averaged 92 per year, and in 1986, the total Corporate

SUBJECT: Project CC Brand Development Plan
T0: Mr. J. D. Phillips

The following Action Plan was developed in response to
recent NFO data that indicated CC Prototypes were deficient
when compared to Merit without concept.
I. Tar Variations 5

New Brand Marketing agreed to open up the tar restraint
of current 8 mg to within the FFLT category. Three 'tar'
categories will be investigated in order to determine the

effect 'tar' has on perception of CC taste, they are 5, 10,
and 15 mg 'tar'. '
II. Pressure Drop of Cigarette ;L

The current CC products were developed at approximately
120mm draft. In previous testing it was determined that in-
creasing the pressure dropped produced a smoother and milder

taste. Two additional drafts at 140mm and 150-160mm will be
investigated.

III. Blend Variations '5
Previous testing with increased turkish tobacco indicated
that an improvement may be made in taste with further increases.

Blends with 20% and 30% turkish tobacco and also elimination
of 67 will be investigated.

IV. Flavor Modifications},

Flavor RhD will provide Brand RhD with three flavor systems
in an attempt to modify the sidestream aroma and taste.

Re: Grant No. 4264Rl
Dear Dr. Templeton:

The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc. (CTR), is pleased to award you a renewal
grant in the amount of $80,000, including indirect costs, for the period from January 1, 1997
through December 31, 1997 for the proposed study: "Regulation of Cell Stress Signaling by a
New Antioxidant Protein." It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by
institutional authorities. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap
promptly so that we can negotiate an appropriate adjustment of our award.

The award is made without guarantee of support beyond December 31, 1997, even though
we recognize that your original application proposed a study extending one year beyond that
date. Therefore, if by May 31, 1997, you submit to us a formal non-competing renewal
application, including a report of your progress, your request will receive consideration,

Please review the enclosed "Important Procedural Information for Grantees." Please ﬁll in
the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me, Contact Drs. Harmon McAllister
or George Hashim of our scientiﬁc staff on matters concerning your grant and keep us informed
about the progress of your study.

The enclosed statement of “Financial Requirements” indicates that the Council recovers
unexpended annual balances over $1,000 and that year end deﬁcits cannot be recovered from
CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Moreover, our failure to receive timely
ﬁnancial statements from your grants ofﬁce will stop further payments. Appropriate forms will
be sent to your ﬁnancial ofﬁcer at the end of the grant year. Administrative problems are
relatively rare and we hope that this will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

minimal if AA were the menthol prestige positioned brand

only Satin offers female intensive image reinforcement.

Thank you for your letter and your publications on hormesis - it really

does seem to be a topic that raises quite a bit of interest. Your question
about caffeine or nicotene is interesting to me because both seem to stimulate
with the assertion that most people are familiar with the hermetic effects

of caffeine, nicotene and ethanol, but somehow it seemed a little trite!

I felt that to remain credible I ought to keep the examples I gave close to
my own field of interest, so the review and my other papers on hormesis deal
only with. growth. I hare not yet found examples in the literature of growth

hormesis with caffeine or nicotene.

In recent months we have been trying to see whether the explanations for
growth hormesis in hydroids (reprint enclosed) applies to other organisms.

I have suggested that hormesis is due to regulatory over-corrections of a
rate-sensitive feedback mechanism that controls growth in hydroids. We have
been seeking evidence for a similar explanation in a marine input and have
shown that it oscillates in the same suggestive way, but in the experiments
thus far the extent. of the growth stimulation is not statistically significant.

Please keep me informed of your own progress with hormesis.

With best wishes.

Yours sincerely,

New York, NY 10022

Dear Dr. McAllister

I am writing this letter to inquire about the possibility of a phase out fund for the (HR
grant 2003 about the puriﬁcation of the adipogenic factor. I am aware that the renewal of
this application was not funded. However. since the submission of the proposal. we have
made considerable progress towards the complete puriﬁcation of the hepatocyte-derived
adipogenic factor. If we could obtain a phase out fund of 15,000 dollars, this will allow
me to continue supporting for 5 months the visiting scientist from Japan who has been
carrying out this project. This will give him the opportunity to complete the very
so hard. Unfortunately, the Cell Science Center is going through a ﬁnancially very
difﬁcult time so that people that would be otherwise supported in the interim by the
institutional fund do not have this opportunity anymore. This will also allow us to obtain
additional data so that we can write application to support the whole project I am aware
that this is a very exceptional request but because of the long standing interest of the
Council for innovative research. I am hopeful that this request will be favorably
evaluated. I will be very happy to provide you with additional data on the progress of the
puriﬁcation of the adipogenic factor if you need them.

1 would like to thank you for your kind consideration in this matter.

Sincerely yours, 9 03M}

This is to update you on the plan for conducting unscheduled DNA

synthesis (U08) and SLRL Drosoghilg assays extramurally. In

conversations with 6. Burger and J. Hayes it was confirmed that we

would ask SR1 and Litton (Hazelton) to conduct the in-vitro UDS

assay using two samples of cigarette condensate. One sample would

be from a Kentucky reference cigarette (1R4F) and the second

comparative sample would be from a RﬁN product. The cost .
associated with this assay for two (2) samples at SRl would be .
$11,000 and at Litton would be $10.400, for a total of $21,400.


fowarding a price list to us for the Qrosoghila assay. Litton

charges $23,500 for a routine Qrosoghila assay. 1 suggest that we

meet with Gary, Johnnie. Chin. and Bob Suber to decide on a

strategy for submitting samples for the Qggsgnnilg assay. 1

samples through the Qrgsoghilg assay at two labs. This is based
upon Litton's price list. This appears to be prohibitive and

should be limited to the minimum number of samples.

  
 

Johnnie Hayes is initiating conversations with Litton and I have
requested a proposal from SRI to conduct the in—vitro UDS assay.
Each lab will also be asked to provide us with a schedule for
initiation of assays and delivery of draft final reports. I expect
that we can have contacts in place and can send samples no later

than October 21, 1885.

As you know, the Arctic Lights brand is scheduled to begin

national advertising on March 26, 1979. Inasmuch as the Arctic Lights
brand will not be introduced until late March, 1979, the

SALEM LIGHTS defensive effort should begin April, 1979. The result'

one week in 120+ Market Importance groupings.

Therefore, this requests that the national break of the SALEM

lnterOfﬁce Memorandum

SUBJECT: Visible Sidestream Smoke Measurement DATE; January 24, 1985

TO: Joe Inman FROM: Michael J. Morton

Brand R&D

INTRODUCTION

Sidestream smoke measurements were taken on 52 products: 11 prototype
products, 16 ultra low tar products, and 25 top brands. The measurements
were made by Becky Dunn and John Aldridge. The sidestream smoke measures
reported were visible absorbence values. Each number reported is the

average of 3 readings. Two different devices were used to make the

and the remaining 7 were measured on the other. Some products, a monitor
product and NOW 85, were smoked on both machines to assess differences in

the two devices, and to monitor the machines’ performance.

The primary goal of the study was to determine which of the 11 prototype
products give off less visible sidestream smoke than all of the 41 commer-
cial products. Additionally, a comparison was made of the two measurement
devices and the visible sidestream smoke values for all products in the

study were compared .

I will first describe the results of a comparison between the two measure-
ment devices and then I will describe the comparison that was made among the
52 products.

DEVICE COMPARISON

An analysis of variance on the two measurement devices showed an average
difference of about .0178 visible absorbance units between the two machines.
(The newer machine read about .0178 lower than the original machine.) That
difference was not quite significant at the .05 level (it yielded a p-value
of .060). So there is some indication of a difference between the two
machines, but it is not statistically significant at the standard level.
The difference was relatively constant for both types of cigarettes that
so-called Monitor product (which had an average absorbence of about .75) and
.0170 units for NOW 85 (which had an average absorbence of about .54).

In the next section, comparisons are made between the products, both assum-
ing that the two devices are indistinguishable, and after adjusting for the
estimated device difference. The conclusion about which prototypes are dis-
tinguishable from the other products is not changed according to which as-
sumption is made.

HEALTH CARE FREEDOMS INITIATIVE

Mark Nelson

RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company
Public Affairs Counsel

PO. Box 12945

Salem. OR 97309


Cena’m industries in the United States, such as the tobacco industry, have been obligated to pay a
disproportionate share of publicly funded health care costs.

With an aging population and an increase in employer mandated health tnSuranoc requirements at
the state level. costs to the tobacco industry are destined to increase. Only drastic change: in the
health care delivery system can prevent this spiraling cost.
Market research indicates 90% of Oregonians want alternative medicine included in their health

plan, That is why the 1995 Oregon Legislature passul an alternative medicine bill. which was
limited in scope,

The New England Joumal of Medicine published a national study done by Harvard University, in
1993, which detcnnlnad that over one-third of Americans use some form of non-traditional health

care and pay for it out of their own pocket This will not change if managed care and insurance
companies have their way.
Meanwhile, proﬁt and not for-proﬁt forces have evenly pressured physicians into the unenviablc
function ofngrcial agent to inc-ruse the proﬁtability of health care organizations. This
central element of the physician-patient relationship. Health care professionals are limingb'
fawd with the dilemma of choosing between patient welfare and the proﬁt of the health care
delivery system We believe this is neither good health care nor beneﬁcial to you and our society

That‘s why Oregonians haVe launched the Health Care Freedoms initiative ( HCFI ), which will:
0 help assure citizens‘ choice of category of health are provnier,
0 put the patient back into the consumer‘s role:
0 lower the overall cost of health care;

0 clear away many of the obstacles between patient and provider and once again allow the free
market to work

Re: Toplines of Menthol Date: July 18, 1988
Migration Study: Interleaved
vs. Direct Application

Backgrogng/Pgrggsg:

The Menthol Developmental Group is exploring the direct application of menthol
onto the carbon sheet as an alternative to the current interleaving process
(I). The level of menthol migration to the fuel source is one of the criteria

by which this decision will be made.

The Shelf Life_6roup assisted by evaluating and comparing menthol migra-
tion to the fuel sources of products incorporating the Interleaving-vs.’the~

direct Application processes.
Procedure:

Cartons of Menthol Alpha products 8040A (Interleaved) and 80408 (Direct) were
exposed to 75 F and 120 F conditions for five days. Menthol determinations
of all components were made at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days. An informal sensory test

was performed at Day 5.

Beadle muiﬂiaaesuuu

As shown in Attachment 1., results from this study suggested menthol migration
to the fuel source is greater for products incorporating the interleaving vs.
direct application processes when these products are exposed to either 75 F

75 F or 120 F conditions.

However, it is known that the base sheet used to make 8040 had a ldwer carbon
activity than the sheet’used to make earlier successful prototypes, 80020 and
80128. In order to achieve a similar menthol load as the tobacco paper plug

' plug used in these prototypes, 4 days of/interleaving were required (vs.
2 days) for 8040A...This resulted in excessive free menthol which would be

MR. HUGH BROOKS

RE: PETERSON PUBLISHING

Dear Hugh:

AS you know, Peterson Publishing has come to us with a proposal
regarding back covers in Motor Trend.

We withdrew from Motor Trend about a month ago. The reason for
BROWN & WILLIAMSON's withdrawal from Motor Trend was that the
corporation had no back cover franchises. Related to our not
having back cover franchises, we felt that the publication‘s
back-up policy of requiring only one inside page for each back

Motor Trend is the most efficient measured magazine for both
KOOL and VICEROY. If it were not for our dispute with the pub—
lication regarding back cover positions for B&W, we certainly
would not have withdrawn from the publication.

The publication has offered us one back cover in 1974 (July is-
sue). In addition, they have offered first option on another
back cover. The Representative (Mr. Dick Opfer) also has indica-
ted that he will try to secure more back covers. The July back
cover would be in trade for one of our existing inside covers.

At the time we exercise the option on the additional back cover,
til we exercise that option, we do not have to give up the inside
covers.

 
_ 4%.»

Although this offer from Motor Trend does not address itself to

the back—up policy is due for further examination by Peterson
management. However, he feels it is quite unlikely that a change
in the back—up policy would be implemented in the very near future.

The net result of the various meetings with Peterson is that BROWN
& WILLIAMSON has gained one back cover franchise and a first option
on another back cover franchise. We believe it is reasonable to
seek a little more.

BACKGROUND

This study was designed to examine the shape of the psychopnysical

percent wet particulate matter left in the sidestream smoke. Previous
studies have exaMined the effect of total removal of particulate
matter and include Irritation Tests 1.2.3 and 6 (report on Irritation
Test 6 will be forthcommino).

METHODS

Testing was similar to that reported by Gayle Ryan in SEO Test Report
No. ﬁPl.

CﬁMEL LIGHT 85's were chosen on the basis of draft (12.2 to 13.4 cm
follows:

. 92.5% HTPH - filter holder without filter

. 55.5% UTPM — filter with two fat short tubes.

34.5% wTPM - filter with one fat short tube.

17.5% HTPM - filter with one long skinny tube.

15.5% NTPM - filter with no dilution tubes.

The filter holder was placed directly above the smoking chamber with

the aid of a Delryn connector. A similar connector was placed on top
of the filter holder to which a Teflon Tee was attached. ﬂlso to this
were the dilution air and the exit tube to the soliniod box.
The method for callibrating the filter pads is described in Appendix
H.

As in prior tests Gayle Ryan was responsible for subject performance
evaluations and statistical analysis. Ruth Webb and Saundra Jacobs
shared the responsibilities for arranging test schedules. running the

test and data entry

Evaluations were performed on 9 sensory attributes (attachment 1)

Dear Fellow Employee:

operatious carried on within the Company, we have outlined in previous .

letters the work performed by seven different Departments. Today we

want to tell you about another important teammate, the Advertising
Department.
This Department is under the management of Mr. W. T. Smither, a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company. His Assistant is
Mr. Ernest M. Fulp. The'ZO employees in the Department are directly

supervised by Mr. W. H. Maddrey, Office Manager, and Mr. Gray N.

Leinbach, Assistant Office Manager.

The operations of the Advertising Department lie along two general

lines. First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every

phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it
follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and
making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget

authorized.
Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping
instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the

Company’s Sales Representatives in the field.
National advertising of the COmpany’s products is one of the most

important phases of its business. It is true that superior quality is in

itself the best advertisement for any product. But alsound and continued

ESTABLISHED BRANDS RESEARCH

WINSTON

0 Results of WINSTON Lights 85's post-production testing were reported.
This test involved two manufactured versions of previously tested 979-0:
lOS7—A, a translation of 979-0 with a 2% weight increase; 1057-3, a
direct translation of 979-6.

Results indicate that both 1057-A and 1057—B were effective translations
of 979—6. Among competitive smokers, 1057-A was at parity with 979—C on
smoothness. Manufactured product 1057-B was also at parity with 979-0
on most attributes but had a directional disadvantage on harshness.

Due to recent improvements in the performance of current WINSTON Lights

85's, neither manufactured product is an improvement versus the in-mar-
ket product among competitive smokers.

— 1057—A shows a directional improvement on harshness, but is at parity

on smoothness. This product also has an advantage 0n mildness, but
has tobacco taste and artificial taste deficiencies.

- 1057-3 is at parity with current on all attributes.

- As shown below, both products are at overall parity with current

WINSTON Lights 85's among competitive smokers and inferior to Marlboro
Lights 85's. -

This forwards for your review the Brand's perspective on the WINSTON
packaging focus groups held in Tampa on May 11 and 12.

Background

The objective of the groups was to evaluate franchise and competitive
smokers' perceptions of pack designs developed for Project Eagle. Focus
ownable elements of the current packaging that could be leveraged or
refined. With this direction, KNT Plusmark developed new packaging
designs for WINSTON. It was a selection of these refined designs that
were tested in Tampa. The information from these latest groups will be
utilized by Brand to provide further developmental direction in the
development of a design for quantitative testing and test market

Methodology

Two franchise and three competitive focus groups were held:

0 Male WINSTON smokers, 35 — 49 years old
0 Female WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old

0 Female Marlboro smokers, 21 — 34 years old
9 Male Marlboro smokers, 21 — 27 years old
0 Male Marlboro smokers, 28 - 34 years old

Current packs were evaluated against five new concepts. Four of the new
designs were very close to current packaging, while one "further out"
design was shown to see how large a change was acceptable. One set of
packs had identical designs in the Full Flavor, except a black vs. a red
logo. Another set of packs had the same design in the Full Flavor,
except one was current WINSTON red while the other was a Marlboro red.

0 Change is acceptable to the franchise. Overall the franchise

groups reacted very favorably to the new designs. In fact. more
radical change than would seem prudent was viewed positively by the
franchise groups. The bottom line seems to be that WINSTON's
franchise is essentially apathetic to their packaging. As aptly
me even if they wrapped them in a brown paper bag." The major
concern expressed by the franchise was market recognition: they
want to be able to quickly recognize and pick up their WINSTONS.

INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM
RE: Web Gathered Cigarette Technology DATE: August 12, 1992

As I mentioned to you earlier, I am very interested in the web
gathered cigarette technology as a means to improve cigarette

Improved cigarette rod uniformity


Elimination of loose ends

Elimination of stem holes

Incorporation of additives such as calcium carbonate to
control burn rate & ash formation

Flavor addition

00000

0

However, I realize this technology is in its exploratory
stages of development and requires additional testing and
refinements before we can consider it as a replacement for out
filler.
As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web
gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/
cigarette-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web
into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel
to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette
technology sooner than originally projected.

In essence, this approach could provide incremental improvements
to our current products while minimizing the risks associated
with a wholesale change.

I look forward to discussing this approach with the team at the
next meeting and appreciate your interest and support.

Subject: Promotion of Carr J. Smith, PhD.

It is with great pleasure that we announce Dr. Carr Srnith’s promotion to Senior Staff Scientist in
Group since November 1992. Over the past eighteen months, his work in meeting the objectives

of the Product Evaluation Group, formerly the Biological Research Group, has been exemplary.
We are pleased to recognize Carr’s efforts with this promotion.

One of the major things that Carr has been able to accomplish in the brief time he has worked with
us is to initiate a program in the area of human cardiovascular disease. Carr has accepted the
carefully reviewed the literature and written several review articles on the relationship between
smoking and cardiovascular disease. One major conclusion is that the cardiovascular risks of
smoking and nicotine use have been grossly exaggerated by individuals outside the Company.
These articles are being submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals. Additionally, Carr
has been actively involved in studies with smokers to support product development efforts.
Carr’s depth of knowledge in human clinical studies is invaluable to all of us. He has been a
critical participant in our continuing efforts to bring scientiﬁc rigor to the question of the health
and he has a key role in our current attempts to educate OSHA on the scientiﬁc facts.

In summary, Carr Smith has been and is performing at a level consistent with the duties and
responsibilities of a Senior Staﬁ‘ Scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are delighted
to have him as part of our team. We look forward to his continuing efforts to provide balance in

upon biological relevance using risk assessment. This results in
a three phase program. Phase 1: consisted of the quantitative
determination of the levels of specific "target" compounds.
Quantitation utilizes the best available methodology. Phase II
consisted of a semi-qualitative and quantitative determination of
NEW CIGARETTE smoke constituents that occur at or above a level
of 0.5 micrograms per cigarette. The 0.5 microgram per cigarette
level was based upon risk assessment. Phase III analysis repre-
sents the determination of the classical "Federal Trade Commis-

sion type" cigarette smoke parameters measuring "tar", nicotine
and carbon monoxide.

Smoke analysis concentrates on the “Tox Model" prototypes.
Analysis is at R. J. Reynolds with specific analysis being
performed at contract laboratories qualified for that analysis.

Dear Wyatt:

Ted, Gary, and I spent the day in Little Rock yesterday riding the
Rich Lights' showing and we were pl eased to find that, with one
exception, all the postings were in very good condition.

The one exception was a SO—sheet board posted at 7th and Park
which was flagging and was also obscured by a tree. Due to the
limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to
a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging
problem.

There were also two locations that we could not find. One is
indicated on the map as a new location at U. S. 67 and 167 near
the l ittle Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on
the .map at the Junction of U. S. 70 and 130. The onlx 30— —lS1eet
Could you please advise the status of these two locations.

Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30—sheet location located

however, we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We

would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising

Could you please check this out for us.

110 East 59th Street

New York, N. Y. 10022

Dear Dr. Sommers:

I would like to clarify some aspects of the Research project which we submitted
directly concerned with an area of cancer research which your organization is interested

relates particularly to chemical carcinogenesis.

We feel that the immune mechanism is far more efficient in preventing the develop—
ment of malignancies than in destroying well established growing tumors. The develop-
ment of many tumors may indeed be considered, at least in part, as the result of failure
of the cellular immunity defense against tumor specific antigens. In these situations,
either the least antigenic malignant cells may be permitted to grow and thus escape
immune defenses, or humoral antibodies may block specific cellular immunity.

Considerable experimental evidence has been obtained in support of the considera-
tions described above. As reported by ourselves and Dr. Old several years ago, it is
relatively easy to demonstrate the increased resistance to tumor induction afforded by
agents which stimulate the immune system, such as BCG but impossible to obtain favorable
results with this type of treatment when the tumors are well established.

Our purpose is to devise better methods of enhancing the immunological reactivity
immunity while depressing undesirable humoral immunity. Thus we plan to significantly
decrease the rate of appearance of tumors induced by chemical carcinogens as well as
increase the time after which they appear. We plan to use inbred mice for these studies
rather than guinea pigs which we used for our studies on protection against leukemia
because the mouse is clearly the animal of choice for these experiments. In addition,
parallel with these studies in mice, the appearance of antibody against known viral
oncogenic agents can be monitored in the sera of the experimental animals. We propose
to use several inbred strains of micelBALB/c, C57, 03H, and AKR and the following
carcinogens, 3-methylcholanthrene and 3,4,—9,lO-dibenzpyrene. We plan to paint or
cedures designed to affect the immune system and its reactivity, such as graft vs host
reactions, treatment with certain bacteria] extracts that have demonstrable adjuvant
effects for cellular immunity. We will then observe the rate of appearance of the
tumor in the population.

In conjunction with these experiments, it seems important to us to develop a
deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system manages to reject
